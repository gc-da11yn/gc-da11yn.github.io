description: Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is a U.S. federal law mandating that federal agencies make their Information and Communication Technology (ICT) accessible to individuals with disabilities. Enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology, the law requires federal agencies to develop, procure, and maintain technology that ensures comparable access for people with disabilities, covering a spectrum of technologies such as websites, software, hardware, and multimedia. The standards set by Section 508 aim to guarantee that individuals with disabilities can access and use information and data on par with those without disabilities, promoting inclusivity and equal participation in the digital realm. Compliance with Section 508 not only benefits federal agencies but also influences industry practices, encouraging broader accessibility standards adoption.
