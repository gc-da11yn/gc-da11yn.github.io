description: The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Standards outline a set of regulations and guidelines aimed at ensuring equal access and opportunities for individuals with disabilities in various aspects of public life. Enacted in 1990, the ADA prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities and mandates that public facilities, businesses, and services be accessible to everyone. The ADA Accessibility Standards provide specific criteria for the design, construction, and alteration of buildings and facilities, as well as guidelines for accessible communication, transportation, and technology. The overarching goal is to create an inclusive and barrier-free environment, fostering equal participation and integration for individuals with disabilities across diverse domains of society.
