<p>
	Virtual meetings and events come in various formats and sizes &ndash; from
	small workshops with participants who know each other to large public
	meetings you are planning. It is critical to ensure meetings and events are
	fully accessible from accessing them, to the presentations. By planning
	ahead, you can build accessibility into all aspects of the meeting. This
	will allow everyone to participate fully, including people with
	disabilities.
