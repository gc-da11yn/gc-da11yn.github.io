		<h2 class="h5"><a href="./low-vision">Low Vision</a></h2>
		<p>
			People with low vision have sight problems that range from slightly
			reduced visual acuity to close to total blindness. This may require
			changes to their desktop area or add-on equipment that helps magnify
			the images on the screen.

		<h2 class="h5"><a href="./blindness">Blindness</a></h2>
		<p>
			People who are blind have a range of conditions from severely
			reduced visual acuity to complete loss of vision and light
			perception. A variety of software and hardware is used to provide

			<a href="./mobility-dexterity">Mobility/Dexterity</a>
		</h2>
		<p>
			Mobility/dexterity impairments range from problems stemming from
			musculoskeletal disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome or back
			pain, to little or no use of one or both hands. Individuals with
			these impairments may require special devices to use computer
			equipment, including modified keyboards, on-screen keyboards or a
			head or foot mouse. They may also need to use word prediction or
			voice recognition systems to help them type.

		<h2 class="h5"><a href="./deafness">Hearing Impairment</a></h2>
		<p>
			The term "hearing impaired" describes people with any degree of
			hearing loss, from mild to profound, including those who are deaf
			and those who are hard of hearing.

	<section class="col-md-6">
		<h2 class="h5"><a href="./cognition">Cognition</a></h2>
		<p>
			Cognitive impairments take many forms, including short and long-term
			memory impairments, and perceptual differences. Language
			impairments, including dyslexia and temporary impairments associated
			with those attempting to learn new languages, are also common
			cognitive problems. Normally a combination of adaptive computer
			technologies is used to help people with cognition problems.
