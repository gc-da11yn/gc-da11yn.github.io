<h2>Information and Awareness on Accessibility Topics</h2>
<p>
	The IT Accessibility Office offers awareness services. We provide
	information on accessibility related matters.

	People with low vision have a decreased ability to see. This impairment is
	to a degree that cannot be corrected by usual means, such as glasses. It can
	affect various aspects of daily life, including work. There exists an
	assortment of hardware, software and tools to amend these afflictions and
	help those who have low vision, some examples are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		User interface scaling to larger easier to identify sizes on Windows and
		Mac
	</li>
	<li>
		Software to enhance and scale user interface beyond operating system
		limitations
	</li>
	<li>Physical computer addons to magnify the monitor</li>
</ul>

				<p>
					known as a CCTV (Closed Circuit Television) or as a Video
					Magnifier, these are generally a combination of a customized
					camera, mount arm for steady hands-free positioning of the
					camera, a viewing screen/monitor, lenses with the ability to
					zoom (in some cases up to 82x magnification), and viewing
					modes with lighting, color, and contrast modes for optimal
					visual assistance. There is often a viewing platform, which
					allows easy positioning of the magnified item, book, or
					image.
