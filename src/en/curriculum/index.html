			<h2>Intention and vision for the accessibility curriculum</h2>
			<p>The new <a href="https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-81/royal-assent"><em>Accessible Canada Act</em></a> will require Innovation, Information and Technology Branch (IITB) employees to be aware of their obligations to ensure an accessible work environment. The list of courses will provide an opportunity for employees to increase their knowledge of accessibility and to better serve internal and external clients. It will also be an opportunity for various target audiences such as Project Managers, IITB developers, programmers and technicians to proactively provide accessible services, software and programs that bring the greatest value to our colleagues who use ACT (adaptive computer technology).</p>

				<h3>IITB's mandate:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>To provide modern, secure, effective and efficient information and technology services that bring the greatest value to clients</li>
					<li>To securely connect information and technology for clients, partnerships and citizens.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>IT Accessibility's mandate:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>To be a leader in accessibility, promoting and enabling an all-inclusive workplace and Service to ESDC employees by providing adaptive technology and accessible solutions.</li>
				</ul>

		<h3>Target learners</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Accessibility has become one of Employment and Social Development Canada's top priorities, therefore training is for the following target audiences:
				<ul>
					<li>All CS01 and CS02 application developers and testers</li>
					<li>CS03 team leads, project leads and IT specialists responsible for application development</li>
					<li>ESDC management</li>
					<li>Writers, editors and translators</li>
					<li>All other ESDC employees</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

	<p>The total amount of time spent on training depends on each employee and his or her current knowledge of accessibility.</p>
	<p>Some of the courses below are provided by external vendors and available only in English. Other courses are available via College@ESDC and Canada School of Public Service. ESDC makes no affiliation with these courses, does not maintain these Web sites, and therefore cannot be responsible for the content found therein.
