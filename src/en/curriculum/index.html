	<h2>Intention and vision for the accessibility curriculum</h2>
	<p>The new <a href="https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-81/royal-assent"><em>Accessible Canada Act</em></a> will require Innovation, Information and Technology Branch (IITB) employees to be aware of their obligations to ensure an accessible work environment. The list of courses will provide an opportunity for employees to increase their knowledge of accessibility and to better serve internal and external clients. It will also be an opportunity for various target audiences such as Project Managers, IITB developers, programmers and technicians to proactively provide accessible services, software and programs that bring the greatest value to our colleagues who use ACT (adaptive computer technology).</p>
