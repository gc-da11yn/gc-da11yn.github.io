<h3>Caveat</h3>
<p>This document was created by the Shared Services Canada (SSC) Accessibility, Accommodations and Adaptive Computer
	Technology (AAACT) program in February 2020 and updated in October 2022. To the best of our knowledge, this document
	was accurate as of October 2022. SSC does not warrant any jurisdiction’s reliance on this work. If you have any
	questions about this document, please <a

		the AAACT program</a></p>

<h3>Intended Audience</h3>
<p>The intended audience is Technical and Contracting Authorities within SSC and the Government of Canada (GC), as well
	as Suppliers who are delivering Information and Communications Technology (ICT) products and services.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>This document deals with technical standards for ICT accessibility. The most common standards are the Web Content
	Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), Revised Section 508 and EN 301 549 Harmonized European Standard for ICT
	Accessibility.</p>
<p>The Revised Section 508 (2017) provides the technical standard for the US government to procure accessible products
	and services. This standard is, by design, closely harmonized with the EN 301 549 (2014) – which drew its
	requirements largely from the original Section 508 standards and WCAG 2.0. Consequently, these standards are very
	similar but do contain key differences. The EN 301 549 has been updated four times since the release of the Revised
	Section 508, introducing further differences between the standards.</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of this document is to identify the similarities and differences between Revised Section 508 and the EN
	301 549 standards.</p>
<p>As the EN 301 549 standards continue to evolve and release updates, this document shows the progression of the EN 301
	549 standards from 2014 through the proceeding updates of 2018, 2019 and 2021. This information is important as the
	GC is moving towards adopting the EN 301 549 (2021) as its accessibility standard for ICT. The GC, as part of the
	solicitation process, may ask suppliers to provide accessibility conformance reports based on the Voluntary Product
	Accessibility Template (VPAT). Each VPAT is based on a specific technical standard – Revised Section 508, EN 301
	549, or WCAG. Suppliers, technical authorities and contracting authorities need to understand the differences
	between these standards to ensure that the accessibility requirements are properly addressed.</p>

<h3>Summary of differences</h3>
<h4>WCAG to Revised Section 508 / EN 301 549</h4>
<p>WCAG, while technology-agnostic, is typically applicable to websites and web applications. For these products,
	specifying WCAG 2.0 level AA or 2.1 level AA as a technical standard may be sufficient. However, the other standards
	include additional requirements which may apply to web applications that provide any of the following features:
	documented accessibility features, authoring tools, two-way communication, video and conversion of information
	between electronic formats. The other standards also include requirements for support and documentation, which may
	apply to website or web application procurements.</p>
<p>Through the WCAG2ICT Task Force, the requirements of WCAG have been adapted to more precisely address the
	requirements for other kinds of ICT including non-web software and non-web documents. These adaptations have been
	integrated into Revised Section 508 and EN 301 549, so specifying those standards will result in clearer
	accessibility requirements for non-web ICT products than specifying WCAG would.</p>
<p>While Revised Section 508 and EN 301 549 include WCAG leveled requirements, these standards have a broader scope. For
	hardware ICT and ICT services, WCAG will not properly address accessibility requirements. If the functionality of
	the product or service may not be fully addressed by WCAG, GC procurements should specify the EN 301 549 standard
</p>

<h4>Revised Section 508 to EN 301 549 (2014)</h4>
<p>These standards are closely harmonized. Some requirements vary in specificity, with the EN 301 549 usually taking a
	more general approach. Revised Section 508 requirements may refer to specific US standards, while the EN 301 549
	either includes the relevant specifications within the document or refers to international standards. Some general
	requirements of Revised Section 508 are only addressed in the Software chapter of the EN 301 549, so the Software
	requirements may need to be included even for hardware devices which have displays.</p>

<h4>EN 301 549 (2014) to EN 301 549 (2018)</h4>
<p>Primarily, WCAG-related chapters (9, 10 and 11) differ between these versions, along with several explanatory
	updates, stylistic rewordings, numbering changes, and functional changes. The 2014 version includes all WCAG 2.0
	level A and AA success criteria, while the 2018 version is updated to directly reference all WCAG 2.1 level A and AA
	success criteria. (Although the 2018 and 2019 versions do not duplicate WCAG text, we have included the new
	requirements with the text in this document for clarity.) The numbering in WCAG-related chapters in the 2018 version
	directly follows WCAG 2.1 success criteria. For example, clause 9.2.3.1 of the EN 301 549 refers to WCAG success
	criterion 2.3.1.</p>

<h4>EN 301 549 (2018) to EN 301 549 (2019)</h4>
<p>The majority of changes are stylistic rewordings and additional explanatory notes. There are 14 new requirements,
	primarily relating to use with limited hearing. A few requirements from the 2018 version have been split up or
	consolidated. Requirements relating to physical access to ICT have been reworked into “8.3 Stationary ICT”.
	Numbering is otherwise consistent between versions</p>


<h4>EN 301 549 (2019) to EN 301 549 (2021)</h4>
<p>The EN 301 549 V3.2.1 (2021) document was developed from EN 301 549 V2.1.2 (2018). There are no new requirements. The
	Annex F track changes table, has been added for future releases. Some clarification in 7.1.1 concerning captioning
	but numbering is otherwise consistent between versions. The numbering in WCAG-related chapters 9, 10 and 11 in the
	2021 version directly follows WCAG 2.1 success criteria. For example, clause 9.2.3.1 of the EN 301 549 (2021) refers
	to WCAG success criterion 2.3.1. As stated in the footnotes, there are items that point to clauses that are not
	included in this document. They are only included if it is a new requirement and it points only to the WCAG
	guidelines.</p>

<h4>Languages / Translations</h4>
<p>If possible:</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
	<li>plan two sessions: one in English and one in French.

		</div>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to host a bilingual meeting, understand that there are barriers that may not be able to be overcome:
</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
	<li>Provide simultaneous translation</li>
	<li>Ensure that the audio is set up so that you get both the speaker and the interpreter on the same audio channel
		for the same language
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<p><strong class="text-uppercase">Tip:</strong> E.g. when an English speaker is speaking English and then
				switches to speak in French, the same audio channel is used so that the translator then comes onto the
				line
				and translates until the speaker resumes speaking English.</p>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>Provide CART (Communication Access Realtime Translation) captioning.</li>
	<li>Ensure separate English and French decks are provided so participants can understand each slide.</li>
