<h2>Accessibility Checker</h2>
<p>The Microsoft Office suite (Word, Excel, Power Point) provides a built-in accessibility validator. The checker does not identify all issues but looks for things such as missing alternative text, duplicate slide titles and potential reading order issues.</p>

<p>How to use the Accessibility Checker:</p>

<ol>
	<li>On the <strong>File</strong> Tab &gt; <strong>Info</strong> &gt; <strong>Check for Issues</strong> &gt; <strong>Check
			Accessibility</strong></li>
	<li>Review the results in the <strong>Accessibility Checker</strong> pane</li>
	<li>Address the listed issues. Helpful information to understand and fix the different issues is provided at the bottom of the pane</li>
</ol>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-7">
		<img class="img-responsive"  src="{{ rootPath }}img/en/office365/powerpoint-365-001.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Check for Issues menu" />
	</div>
</div>

<p>The <strong>Accessibility Checker</strong> is also located on the Ribbon under the <strong>Review</strong> tab > <strong>Check Accessibility</strong>. Activate the "Keep accessibility checker running while I work" check box in the checker pane to keep track of accessibility issues in real time.</p>

<h2>PowerPoint structure</h2>

<h3>Design themes</h3>

<p>The slide theme or template has a large effect on
	accessibility. The <strong>Design</strong>
	tab contains many built-in <strong>Themes</strong>
	and colour <strong>Variants</strong>
	that can be used to change the look of a presentation. PowerPoint also offers
	the ability to create custom themes.</p>

<p>Choose themes that meet colour contrast requirements and that
	have simple backgrounds making them easier to read. If the presentation will be
	viewed on a projector, the contrast and readability may need to be even more pronounced
	than on a computer monitor.</p>

<h3>Slide title</h3>

<p>Give every slide a unique title. People who have vision loss
	or learning / cognitive disabilities rely on slide titles to navigate. For
	example, by skimming or using a screen reader, they can quickly scan through a
	list of slide titles and go right to the slide they want.</p>

<ol>
	<li>To restore
		all placeholders for the selected slide, on the <strong>Home</strong> tab, in the <strong>Slides</strong>
		group, select <strong>Reset</strong></li>
	<li>On the
		slide, type a unique and descriptive title</li>
</ol>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-7">
		<img class="img-responsive"  src="{{ rootPath }}img/en/office365/powerpoint-365-002.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Slides group in Home tab" />
	</div>
</div>

<p>To make a title invisible on
	the slide, but still voiced by screen readers:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The <strong>Home</strong>
		tab, in the <strong>Drawing</strong> group, select <strong>Arrange</strong></li>
	<li>In the <strong>Arrange</strong>
		menu, select <strong>Selection Pane</strong></li>
	<li>In the <strong>Selection</strong>
		pane, locate the <strong>Title</strong> text box, and then activate the eye icon next to
		it</li>
</ol>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-7">
		<img class="img-responsive"  src="{{ rootPath }}img/en/office365/powerpoint-365-003.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Arrange menu" />
	</div>
</div>

<h3>Text structure</h3>

<h4>Text formatting</h4>

<p>Ensure that the type is large enough to read easily. If your
	presentation will be viewed via projector, the type should be larger than on
	printed handouts. </p>

<p>Recommended formatting to improve legibility:</p>

<ul>
	<li>30-point
		type</li>
	<li>Sans-serif
		fonts, such as Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, or Calibri</li>
</ul>

<p>Three to seven bullet points per slide is a good rule of
	thumb.</p>

<p>Avoid using all capitals or excessive italics or bold.</p>

<p>Ensure there are blank spaces between sentences or
	paragraphs.</p>


<h4>Headings</h4>

<p>Ensure headings and labels are descriptive and unique.
	Section headings facilitate navigation and comprehension of presentations. To
	evaluate headings:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Determine
		if headings and labels are provided</li>
	<li>Are
		the headings descriptive?</li>
	<li>Are
		the headings and labels unique?</li>
	<li>Are
		the headings provided using titles and sub-title placeholders? </li>
</ul>

<p>To verify that headings and labels have been properly
	structured, navigate on the <strong>Home</strong> tab to <strong>Slides</strong>, select <strong>Slide
		Layout</strong>. Verify that the slide layout matches the layout on the current
	slide.</p>

<h3>Reading order</h3>

<p>By default, a screen reader will read the slide title first,
	followed by other content in elements defined in the slide layout. Then it will
	read any additional content on the side in the order it was added to the slide.
	If you add content with this principle in mind, it should be presented to
	screen reader users in a logical order.</p>

<p>Use
	the <strong>Selection</strong><strong> Pane</strong> to set the order in which the screen readers
	read the slide contents. The Pane will show every object onn the slide. Highlighting an object in
	the pane will also highlight it in the slide. </p>

<p>To check the reading order: </p>

<ol>
	<li>Click in the blank space just outside the slide. </li>
	<li>Press the "Tab" key repeatedly. The order in which objects are selected should match the logical reading order.</li>
</ol>

<p>To change the reading order: </p>

<ol>
	<li>On the <strong>Home</strong>
		tab, in the <strong>Drawing</strong> group, select <strong>Arrange</strong></li>
	<li>In the <strong>Arrange</strong>
		menu, select <strong>Selection Pane</strong></li>
	<li>In the <strong>Selection</strong><strong>
			Pane</strong>, to change the reading order, do one of the following:
		<ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
			<li>Drag and drop
				items to the new location</li>
			<li>Select the item
				and then select the Up arrow button (Bring Forward) or Down arrow button (Send
				Backward)</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

	<div class="col-md-7">
		<img class="img-responsive"  src="{{ rootPath }}img/en/office365/powerpoint-365-004.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Arrange menu" />
	</div>
</div>

<h3>Tables</h3>

<p>PowerPoint allows you to identify a single row of column
	headers and a single column of row headers.</p>

<p>Most screen readers do not identify table headers in
	PowerPoint, but we still recommend going through this process. It is important
	to identify headers visually. These headers will be maintained when saving to
	PDF.</p>

<p>To identify table headers:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Focus the
		table by clicking inside or tabbing to the content. The Table Tools options
		should appear and the <strong>Design</strong> tab should be open</li>
	<li>If the top
		row of the table contains headers for each column (most tables do), make sure
		the <strong>Header Row</strong> checkbox is checked</li>
	<li>If the
		first column of the table contains headers for each row, make sure the <strong>First
			Column</strong> checkbox is checked</li>
	<li>In the Table Styles section, select a
		style where the table headers are clearly identified visually. Make sure the
		style has good contrast </li>
</ol>

<h2>Visuals and alternative
	text (“alt text”)</h2>

<p>Use alt text to describe pictures, images, graphics, graphs,
	tables, and flowcharts, so that a screen reader can access them.</p>

<p>Alt text should always communicate the purpose of visual
	images accurately and succinctly. In general, it is a short description of the
	image that answers the question “What information is this image conveying?”. A longer
	description may be needed for complex diagrams and images. General guidelines
	for creating alt text include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Don’t repeat the text of an adjacent caption. Screen readers read both the caption and the alt text, so avoid having the same details in both.</li>
	<li>Use punctuation for full sentences</li>
</ul>

<h3>Images</h3>

<p>PowerPoint presentations usually include images. Images need equivalent alternative text. To add <strong>alt text</strong> to an image:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Select the image </li>
	<li>Open the <strong>Format</strong> tab in the ribbon </li>
	<li>Activate the <strong>Alt Text</strong> tool </li>
	<li>If an image conveys no meaningful information (i.e. it is decorative or redundant) check "Mark as decorative" </li>
	<li>If the image is meaningful, convey in words the meaning, function, or purpose communicated by the image </li>
	<li>Activate the <strong>Close</strong> button </li>
</ol>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-7">
		<img class="img-responsive"  src="{{ rootPath }}img/en/office365/powerpoint-365-005.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Format Picture tool">
	</div>
</div>

<p>Be sure to check and update any automatically generated alternative text for images.</p>

<p>Tips and Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Don’t
		begin with the words “Image of” at the start of the alt text. Screen readers
		tell the user that there is an image and then read the alt text.</li>
	<li>Do
		begin with “Screenshot of…” if the image is a screenshot</li>
</ul>

<h3>SmartArt graphics (charts
	and diagrams)</h3>

<p>Ensure complex images and charts provide long descriptions. Complex
	images include schematics, plans, diagrams or any other image that conveys a
	large amount of information. This is necessary as users who cannot see the
	complex image will not be able to sufficiently determine its value/purpose.</p>

<p>To add a long description to a diagram or chart:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open the
		context menu for the chart/diagram and activate <strong>Edit Alt Text</strong></li>
	<li>The <strong>Alt Text</strong>
		sidebar will appear</li>
	<li>Provide a
		meaningful long description
		<ol>
			<li>Describe the
				title of the chart / diagram</li>
			<li>The role it
				plays in the document</li>
			<li>The
				relationship of elements in the correct order </li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Activate the <strong>Close</strong> Button</li>
</ol>

<p>Ensure that colour is not being used as the only way information is
	being conveyed in any graphics.</p>

<h3>Video and audio</h3>

<p>PowerPoint 2016 supports the playback of video with multiple
	audio tracks. It also supports closed captions and subtitles that are embedded
	in video files.</p>

<p>Supported video formats for captions and subtitles vary
	depending on the operating system that you're using. Each operating system has
	settings to adjust how the closed captions or subtitles are displayed. Embedded
	audio also requires a transcript. Closed captions typically also describe audio
	cues such as music or sound effects that occur off-screen. </p>

<p>Video description means audio-narrated descriptions of a
	video's key visual elements. These descriptions are inserted into natural
	pauses in the program's dialogue. Video description makes video more accessible
	to individuals who are blind or visually impaired. Subtitles typically contain
	a transcription (or translation) of the dialogue.</p>

<p>If you embed video, make sure that the player controls —
	start, pause and stop — are accessible using the keyboard.</p>

<h2>Additional features</h2>

<h3>Transitions and animations</h3>

<p>It
	is best practice to keep any transitions and animations simple and brief.
	Complex or automatic transitions and animations can be distracting or add a
	layer of further comprehension that is unnecessary. </p>


<p>Limiting
	the use of transitions and animation to one per slide will help to improve the
	usability of your presentation for screen reader users. If you must use
	Animations in your PowerPoint presentations, they should be made accessible. </p>


<p>In
	addition, you should carefully consider your use of decorative animations.
	Constant motion on the screen may cause a screen reader to refresh frequently,
	thus making the presentation more difficult to use. Keeping animations to a
	minimum or eliminating them altogether will increase the accessibility of your
	content.</p>

<h3>Grouping elements</h3>

<p>Grouping visual elements such as images, shapes, or SmartArt
	should generally be avoided as it changes the information that will be read by
	screen readers. </p>

<p>However, if it is more meaningful to group elements that
	have a relationship, there are techniques to do so. When using the Group<strong> </strong>feature
	to combine visual elements, ensure that sufficient alt text<strong> </strong>is used to
	indicate any conveyed information to the user. Correspondingly, if the grouped
	elements are purely decorative, indicate this in your alt text by marking it as
	such.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Select the
		visual elements you want to group together while holding down <strong>CTRL</strong></li>
	<li>Open the
		context menu and activate <strong>Group</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, you can select the elements you want to group and on the Drawing Tools
	&gt; <strong>Format</strong> tab, activate <strong>Group</strong> &gt; <strong>Group</strong></p>
