## Caveat

This document was created by the Shared Services Canada (SSC) Accessibility, Accommodations and Adaptive Computer Technology (AAACT) program in February 2020 and updated in October 2022. To the best of our knowledge, this document was accurate as of October 2022. SSC does not warrant any jurisdiction’s reliance on this work.

## Intended Audience

The intended audience is Technical and Contracting Authorities within SSC and the Government of Canada (GC), as well as Suppliers who are delivering Information and Communications Technology (ICT) products and services.

## Background

This document deals with technical standards for ICT accessibility. The most common standards are the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), Revised Section 508 and EN 301 549 Harmonized European Standard for ICT Accessibility.

The Revised Section 508 (2017) provides the technical standard for the US government to procure accessible products and services. This standard is, by design, closely harmonized with the EN 301 549 (2014) – which drew its requirements largely from the original Section 508 standards and WCAG 2.0. Consequently, these standards are very similar but do contain key differences. The EN 301 549 has been updated four times since the release of the Revised Section 508, introducing further differences between the standards.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to identify the similarities and differences between Revised Section 508 and the EN 301 549 standards.

As the EN 301 549 standards continue to evolve and release updates, this document shows the progression of the EN 301 549 standards from 2014 through the proceeding updates of 2018, 2019 and 2021. This information is important as the GC is moving towards adopting the EN 301 549 (2021) as its accessibility standard for ICT. The GC, as part of the solicitation process, may ask suppliers to provide accessibility conformance reports based on the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT). Each VPAT is based on a specific technical standard – Revised Section 508, EN 301 549, or WCAG. Suppliers, technical authorities and contracting authorities need to understand the differences between these standards to ensure that the accessibility requirements are properly addressed.

## Summary of differences

### WCAG to Revised Section 508 / EN 301 549

WCAG, while technology-agnostic, is typically applicable to websites and web applications. For these products, specifying WCAG 2.0 level AA or 2.1 level AA as a technical standard may be sufficient. However, the other standards include additional requirements which may apply to web applications that provide any of the following features: documented accessibility features, authoring tools, two-way communication, video and conversion of information between electronic formats. The other standards also include requirements for support and documentation, which may apply to website or web application procurements.

Through the WCAG2ICT Task Force, the requirements of WCAG have been adapted to more precisely address the requirements for other kinds of ICT including non-web software and non-web documents. These adaptations have been integrated into Revised Section 508 and EN 301 549, so specifying those standards will result in clearer accessibility requirements for non-web ICT products than specifying WCAG would.

While Revised Section 508 and EN 301 549 include WCAG leveled requirements, these standards have a broader scope. For hardware ICT and ICT services, WCAG will not properly address accessibility requirements. If the functionality of the product or service may not be fully addressed by WCAG, GC procurements should specify the EN 301 549 standard.

### Revised Section 508 to EN 301 549 (2014)

These standards are closely harmonized. Some requirements vary in specificity, with the EN 301 549 usually taking a more general approach. Revised Section 508 requirements may refer to specific US standards, while the EN 301 549 either includes the relevant specifications within the document or refers to international standards. Some general requirements of Revised Section 508 are only addressed in the Software chapter of the EN 301 549, so the Software requirements may need to be included even for hardware devices which have displays.

### EN 301 549 (2014) to EN 301 549 (2018)

Primarily, WCAG-related chapters (9, 10 and 11) differ between these versions, along with several explanatory updates, stylistic rewordings, numbering changes, and functional changes. The 2014 version includes all WCAG 2.0 level A and AA success criteria, while the 2018 version is updated to directly reference all WCAG 2.1 level A and AA success criteria. (Although the 2018 and 2019 versions do not duplicate WCAG text, we have included the new requirements with the text in this document for clarity.) The numbering in WCAG-related chapters in the 2018 version directly follows WCAG 2.1 success criteria. For example, clause 9.2.3.1 of the EN 301 549 refers to WCAG success criterion 2.3.1.

### EN 301 549 (2018) to EN 301 549 (2019)

The majority of changes are stylistic rewordings and additional explanatory notes. There are 14 new requirements, primarily relating to use with limited hearing. A few requirements from the 2018 version have been split up or consolidated. Requirements relating to physical access to ICT have been reworked into “8.3 Stationary ICT”. Numbering is otherwise consistent between versions.

### EN 301 549 (2019) to EN 301 549 (2021)

The EN 301 549 V3.2.1 (2021) document was developed from EN 301 549 V2.1.2 (2018). There are no new requirements. The Annex F track changes table, has been added for future releases. Some clarification in 7.1.1 concerning captioning but numbering is otherwise consistent between versions. The numbering in WCAG-related chapters 9, 10 and 11 in the 2021 version directly follows WCAG 2.1 success criteria. For example, clause 9.2.3.1 of the EN 301 549 (2021) refers to WCAG success criterion 2.3.1. As stated in the footnotes, there are items that point to clauses that are not included in this document. They are only included if it is a new requirement and it points only to the WCAG guidelines.

  <dt>Functional change:</dt>
  <dd>the text of the criterion significantly changes what the criterion is asking for, for example: the word “should” (denoting a recommendation) is replaced by the word “shall” (denoting a requirement)</dd>
  <dt>Explanatory update:</dt>
  <dd>the text has content or stipulations that clarify the purpose of the criterion without changing its purpose outright, such as specifying the source of a document</dd>
  <dt>Numbering change:</dt>
  <dd>the numbering is the criterion is updated due to either integration of WCAG numbering into the document, or changing the order in which they appear in the document for better flow and understanding</dd>
  <dt>New requirement:</dt>
  <dd>a criterion that does not exist in a previous version of the EN 301 549 document. Several new criteria were added in the 2019 version that do not appear in either the 2014 or 2018 version</dd>

         <p><strong>NOTE 1: With many-party communication, as in a conference system, it is allowed (but not required or necessarily recommended) that RTT be handled in a single display field and that "turn-taking" be necessary to avoid confusion (in the same way that turn-taking is required for those presenting/talking with voice).</strong></p>
         <p><strong>NOTE 2: With many-party communication, best practice is for hand-raising for voice users and RTT users to be handled in the same way, so that voice and RTT users are in the same queue.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>NOTE 3: With a many-party conference system that has chat as one of its features - the RTT (like the voice) would typically be separate from the chat so that RTT use does not interfere with chat (i.e. people can be messaging in the chat field while the person is presenting/talking with RTT - in the same manner that people message using the chat feature while people are talking with voice). RTT users would then use RTT for presenting and use the Chat feature to message while others are presenting (via Voice or RTT).</strong></p>
         <p><strong>NOTE 4: The availability of voice and RTT running concurrently (and separately from chat) can also allow the RTT field to support text captioning when someone is speaking (and it is therefore not being used for RTT since it is not the RTT user's turn to speak).</strong></p>
         <p><strong>NOTE 5: Where both server-side software and local hardware and software are required to provide voice communication, where neither part can support voice communication without the other and are sold as a unit for the voice communication function, the local and server-side components are considered a single product.</strong></p>

         <p>6.2.1.2 Concurrent voice and text</p>
         <p>Where ICT provides a means for two-way voice communication and for users to communicate by RTT, it shall allow concurrent voice and text through a single user connection.</p>
         <p>NOTE 1: With many-party communication, as in a conference system, it is allowed (but not required or necessarily recommended) that RTT be handled in a single display field and that "turn-taking" be necessary to avoid confusion (in the same way that turn-taking is required for those presenting/talking with voice).</p>
         <p>NOTE 2: With many-party communication, best practice is for hand-raising for voice users and RTT users to be handled in the same way, so that voice and RTT users are in the same queue.</p>
         <p>NOTE 3: With a many-party conference system that has chat as one of its features - the RTT (like the voice) would typically be separate from the chat so that RTT use does not interfere with chat (i.e. people can be messaging in the chat field while the person is presenting/talking with RTT - in the same manner that people message using the chat feature while people are talking with voice). RTT users would then use RTT for presenting and use the Chat feature to message while others are presenting (via Voice or RTT).</p>
         <p>NOTE 4: The availability of voice and RTT running concurrently (and separately from chat) can also allow the RTT field to support text captioning when someone is speaking (and it is therefore not being used for RTT since it is not the RTT user's turn to speak).</p>
         <p>NOTE 5: Where both server-side software and local hardware and software are required to provide voice communication, where neither part can support voice communication without the other and are sold as a unit for the voice communication function, the local and server-side components are considered a single product.</p>
