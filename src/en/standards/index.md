## What is <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr>?

<abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> refers to the infrastructure and components that enable modern computing. <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> includes digital tools, equipment and systems that are used to create, store, manage and transmit information.
In the context of the standard, accessible <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> refers to the ability to use <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr>, regardless of one’s level of ability.

## Background

The [_Accessible Canada Act (<abbr>ACA</abbr>)_](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-0.6/index.html) was passed in 2019 to make Canada barrier-free by 2040. The <abbr title="Accessible Canada Act">ACA</abbr> aims to identify, remove, and prevent barriers that limit persons with disabilities from fully and equally participating in Canadian society. To respond to the act, the Government of Canada launched the [Accessibility Strategy for the Public Service of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/diversity-inclusion-public-service/accessibility-public-service/accessibility-strategy-public-service-toc.html), also referred to as “Nothing Without Us," and the [Guideline on Making Information Technology Usable by All.](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32620)

## Objective

To fulfill Goal 3, “Making <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> usable by all,” of the [_Accessibility Strategy for the Public Service_](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/diversity-inclusion-public-service/accessibility-public-service/accessibility-strategy-public-service-toc.html), the new standard will:

- aim to identify, remove and prevent <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> accessibility barriers across the Government of Canada
- contribute to the accessibility strategy’s vision that all <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> used by the Government of Canada can be independently accessed and used by employees and the public, regardless of one’s abilities or disabilities

## The Standard

The Government of Canada’s [_Standard on <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> Accessibility_](./standard) will:

- replace the government’s current [_Standard on Web Accessibility_](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=23601)
- harmonize with the [_Harmonised European Standard: Accessibility Requirements for <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> Products and Services (EN&nbsp;301&nbsp;549)_](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf)

We are harmonizing with the _Harmonised European Standard_ to provide a framework to update accessibility requirements over time. This harmonization will help Canada become a global leader in <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> accessibility and will enable the Canadian federal public service to identify, remove and prevent accessibility barriers to new, existing and future <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr>.

Phase One of the Standard will focus on foundational elements of <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> accessibility, including requirements for new <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr>, most assessments, training, performance and reporting and user feedback.

## How to get involved?
