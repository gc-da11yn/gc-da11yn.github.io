## What is <abbr>ICT</abbr>?

<abbr>ICT</abbr> refers to the infrastructure and components that enable modern computing. <abbr>ICT</abbr> includes digital tools, equipment and systems that are used to create, store, manage and transmit information.
In the context of the standard, accessible <abbr>ICT</abbr> refers to the ability to use <abbr>ICT</abbr>, regardless of one’s level of ability.

## Background

The [_Accessible Canada Act (<abbr>ACA</abbr>)_](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-0.6/index.html) was passed in 2019 to make Canada barrier-free by 2040. The <abbr>ACA</abbr> aims to identify, remove, and prevent barriers that limit persons with disabilities from fully and equally participating in Canadian society. To respond to the act, the Government of Canada launched the [Accessibility Strategy for the Public Service of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/diversity-inclusion-public-service/accessibility-public-service/accessibility-strategy-public-service-toc.html), also referred to as “Nothing Without Us," and the [Guideline on Making Information Technology Usable by All.](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32620)

## Objective

To fulfill Goal 3, “Making <abbr>ICT</abbr> usable by all,” of the [_Accessibility Strategy for the Public Service_](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/diversity-inclusion-public-service/accessibility-public-service/accessibility-strategy-public-service-toc.html), the new standard will:

- aim to identify, remove and prevent <abbr>ICT</abbr> accessibility barriers across the Government of Canada
- contribute to the accessibility strategy’s vision that all <abbr>ICT</abbr> used by the Government of Canada can be independently accessed and used by employees and the public, regardless of one’s abilities or disabilities

## The Standard

The Government of Canada’s _Standard on <abbr>ICT</abbr> Accessibility_ will:

- replace the government’s current _Standard on Web Accessibility_
- harmonize with the [_Harmonised European Standard: Accessibility Requirements for <abbr>ICT</abbr> Products and Services (EN 301 549)_](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf)

We are harmonizing with the _Harmonised European Standard_ to provide a framework to update accessibility requirements over time. This harmonization will help Canada become a global leader in <abbr>ICT</abbr> accessibility and will enable the Canadian federal public service to identify, remove and prevent accessibility barriers to new, existing and future <abbr>ICT</abbr>.

Phase One of the Standard will focus on foundational elements of <abbr>ICT</abbr> accessibility, including requirements for new <abbr>ICT</abbr>, most assessments, training, performance and reporting and user feedback.

## How to get involved?

To foster a participative engagement process, select stakeholders will be invited to:

- Review the _Standard on Information and Communication Technologies (<abbr>ICT</abbr>) Accessibility_ in full, the proposed accessibility requirements and the associated implementation timelines
- Consult the [background document](./backgrounder) with a description of each requirement
- Submit your confidential and anonymous feedback by completing our [feedback submission form](#) **[insert link]**
