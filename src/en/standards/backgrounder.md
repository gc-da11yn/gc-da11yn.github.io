## Context

One in six people in Canada has a disability. Accessible information and communication technology ensures that people with disabilities can access and use Government of Canada services without barriers. Making services accessible to people with disabilities makes them accessible to everyone.

As technology continues to evolve, the Government of Canada has an obligation to make sure the next generation of technological solutions are developed with accessibility at their core so that no one is left behind.

The release of the _[Accessible Canada Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-0.6/)_, the [Accessibility Strategy for the Public Service of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/diversity-inclusion-public-service/accessibility-public-service/accessibility-strategy-public-service-toc/accessibility-strategy-public-service-technology.html) and the [Guideline for Making Information Technology Usable for All](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32620) in 2019 led to many initiatives across the Government of Canada to make <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology Accessibility">ICT</abbr> barrier-free. One of these initiatives was the drafting of the _Standard on Information and Communication Technology Accessibility_. This standard, which will replace the _Standard on Web Accessibility_, will expand the scope of accessibility requirements under the _Policy on Service and Digital_. The standard will be harmonized with the <a download="download" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf"><em>Harmonised European Standard on Accessibility Requirements for <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology Accessibility">ICT</abbr> Products and Services (2021) (EN&nbsp;301&nbsp;549)</em> (PDF, 2.3MB)</a> to: meet all relevant requirements in the act and strategy; align with international best practices; and align with <a download="download" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf"><em>EN&nbsp;301&nbsp;549</em> (PDF, 2.3MB)</a> (2021 and future updates).

## About the standard

The standard contains requirements for:

- procurement of information and communication technology goods and services
- web content
- non-web documents
- enterprise and departmental software
- native mobile applications
- hardware
- user feedback
- workforce capacity and capabilities
- planning and performance reporting

An accompanying scorecard and maturity model are being developed for departments to use to assess their progress towards achieving the goal of making <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology Accessibility">ICT</abbr> usable by all.

In November 2021, the Office of the Chief Information Officer conducted government‑wide consultations on the draft standard and on an accessibility measurement Scorecard. The consultations revealed that departments thought they lacked the resources and technical expertise to implement the standard in full.

To make sure all new <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology Accessibility">ICT</abbr> used in the federal government is accessible, and to give departments time to make existing technology accessible, we are publishing the standard in two phases:

- **Phase 1** contains requirements that are relatively low cost and low risk to implement
- **Phase 2** contains requirements that are more expensive and more difficult to implement

## Procurement of information and communication technology goods and services

      <td>Effective date of standard + 12 months</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

After we publish Phase 1 of the standard, all new web content (public-facing **and** internal web) will have to be accessible and satisfy the clauses in <a download="download" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf"><em>EN&nbsp;301&nbsp;549</em> (PDF, 2.3MB)</a>.

Departments will have to include an accessibility statement with all new web content. This statement highlights important information about the accessibility of the content. For example:

- the level of accessibility of the website (according to the <a download="download" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf"><em>EN&nbsp;301&nbsp;549</em> (PDF, 2.3MB)</a> / [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) assessment criteria)
- any parts of the site that are not accessible
- what your organization has done to make sure the site is accessible
- contact information for where users can report accessibility problems

More information about accessibility statements will be provided in official standard guidance.

### Existing public-facing content: conformance testing

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-2">Number</th>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-7">Requirement</th>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-2">Date to meet</th>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>2.1.2.2</td>
      <td>Accessibility conformance testing against the <a download="download" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf"><em>EN&nbsp;301&nbsp;549</em> (PDF, 2.3MB)</a> standard must be conducted for all existing public-facing web content used by the department</td>
      <td>Effective date of standard + 12 months</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Before departments can conform with the requirements set out in this standard, they will need to first assess their existing public-facing web content. Departments can use a combination of manual and automated tools to assess their existing public-facing web content. They can also have users test it. If a department doesn’t have access to internal testers, it can hire third-party testers.

### Existing public-facing content: accessibility statement and feedback mechanism

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-2">Number</th>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-7">Requirement</th>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-2">Date to meet</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>2.1.2.3</td>
      <td>All existing public-facing web pages must feature an accessibility statement and a user feedback mechanism;</td>
      <td>Effective date of standard + 12 months</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Public-facing web content includes material on Canada.ca and material on departmental websites.

Before departments assess their existing public-facing web content, they will have to provide a mechanism that lets users provide feedback on the site they are visiting. Feedback can include broken links, spelling or grammar errors, and problems with accessibility. An example of a user feedback mechanism is the one on Canada.ca.

Departments will have to include an accessibility statement on all their existing public-facing web content. The accessibility statement highlights important information about the accessibility of the web content being on the web page. For example:

- the level of accessibility of the web page (according to the <a download="download" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf"><em>EN&nbsp;301&nbsp;549</em> (PDF, 2.3MB)</a> / [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) assessment criteria)
- any parts of the web page that are not accessible
- what your organization has done to make sure the web page is accessible
- contact information on the web page where users can request assistance navigating the web page and accessing the web content

More information about accessibility statements will be provided in official standard guidance.

### Existing internal-facing content: conformance testing

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-2">Number</th>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-7">Requirement</th>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-2">Date to meet</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>2.1.2.4</td>
      <td>Accessibility conformance testing against the <a download="download" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf"><em>EN&nbsp;301&nbsp;549</em> (PDF, 2.3MB)</a> standard must be conducted for all existing internal-facing web content used by the department</td>
      <td>Effective date of standard + 24 months</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Internal‑facing web content is material that is posted on pages that can’t be accessed from outside the Government of Canada (for example, departmental intranet pages). Before departments can conform with the requirements set out in this standard, they will need to first assess their existing internal-facing web content. Departments can assess their existing internal-facing websites with a combination of manual and automated assessment tools and with user testing. Hiring of third-party accessibility conformance testers is also an option should the department not have access to internal GC testers.

## Non-web documents

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-2">Number</th>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-7">Requirement</th>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-2">Date to meet</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>2.1.3.1</td>
      <td>Departments must provide an accessible version of any non-web document when requested</td>
      <td>Effective date of standard</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Non-web documents can include Microsoft Word documents, PowerPoint slides, Excel spreadsheets and PDF files.

When a member of the public or a Government of Canada employee requests an accessible version of a non-web document, the department will be required to provide one. Departments should therefore, whenever possible, create non-web documents in an accessible format.

## Enterprise and departmental software

### New enterprise and departmental software: compliance, accessibility statement

<table class="table table-bordered">

      <td>Effective date of standard + 12 months</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Following the publication of the Standard on <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology Accessibility">ICT</abbr> Accessibility (Phase 1), all new enterprise and departmental software will need to satisfy the clauses in <a download="download" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf"><em>EN&nbsp;301&nbsp;549</em> (PDF, 2.3MB)</a>

Departments will have to include an accessibility statement with all new enterprise and departmental software. This statement highlights important information about the accessibility of the software being used. For example:

- the level of accessibility of the software application (according to the <a download="download" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf"><em>EN&nbsp;301&nbsp;549</em> (PDF, 2.3MB)</a> / [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) assessment criteria)
- any parts of the software that are not accessible
- what your organization has done to make sure the software is accessible
- contact information for where users can report accessibility problems

More information about accessibility statements will be provided in official standard guidance.

### Accessibility features

      <td>Effective date of standard</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Accessibility features include features to improve contrast and compatibility with assistive technologies.

When implementing built-in accessibility features, under subsection B.2.6 of the [Mandatory Procedures for Information Technology Security Control](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32611), deputy heads must “implement IT security assessment and authorization processes to establish and maintain confidence in the security of information systems that are used or managed by the department, while considering stakeholder security requirements.”

## Native mobile applications (apps)

A native mobile application (app) is an app that is installed locally on a mobile device such as a smartphone or a tablet. The ArriveCAN app is an example of a native mobile app.

### New native mobile apps: compliance and accessibility statement

<table class="table table-bordered">

Before departments can conform with the requirements set out in this standard, they will need to assess their existing native mobile apps. Departments can assess their existing native mobile applications with a combination of manual and automated assessment tools and with user testing. Hiring of third-party accessibility conformance testers is also an option should the department not have access to internal GC testers.

## Hardware

### Accessibility features: available to users by default

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-2">Number</th>

      <td>Features that improve accessibility on all new hardware must be made available to users by default unless an exception has been granted</td>
      <td>Effective date of standard</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Hardware includes keyboards, computer mice, and stationary <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology Accessibility">ICT</abbr>. Any feature that improves accessibility (i.e., text-to-speech, closed-captioning, and keyboard shortcuts, etc.) on any new hardware will need to be made available to all users from the outset.

When implementing built-in accessibility features, under subsection B.2.6 of the [Mandatory Procedures for Information Technology Security Control](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32611), deputy heads must “implement IT security assessment and authorization processes to establish and maintain confidence in the security of information systems that are used or managed by the department, while considering stakeholder security requirements.”

## User feedback

      <td>Effective date of standard</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Whatever <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology Accessibility">ICT</abbr> is being used; users will need a mechanism for providing feedback to the department on accessibility issues. Departments can do this is by integrating a user feedback form into their <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology Accessibility">ICT</abbr>.

## Workforce capacity and capabilities

### Training and tools for accessibly <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology Accessibility">ICT</abbr>

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>

      <td>Effective date of standard + 12 months</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Departments will be required to ensure that accessibility is embedded into the design and delivery of training so that all tools and training materials are available for all functional communities. The development of the necessary training and tools for accessible <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology Accessibility">ICT</abbr> for GC employees will help prevent the creation of new barriers to <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology Accessibility">ICT</abbr>.

### Learning for all employees

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col" class="col-sm-2">Number</th>

      <td>Effective date of standard + 12 months</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Accessibility benefits everyone and its implementation is all our responsibility. Departments are responsible for making sure that learning opportunities are provided to their staff, such as training about accessibility, intersectionality, and unconscious bias.

Training and awareness-raising events through the Canada School of Public Service and the Federal Speakers’ Bureau on Healthy Workplaces, among other venues, can be developed to combat myths and remove stigma of disability.

This requirement also aligns with the _Policy on Service and Digital_’s requirement for departments to provide internal activities by requiring that these learning opportunities be available to all employees.

### Learning for employees who specialize in information, communication and technology

<table class="table table-bordered">

      <td>Effective date of standard + 12 months</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Departments are responsible for making sure learning opportunities are provided to employees who work in <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology Accessibility">ICT</abbr>. Learning could cover topics such as accessible procurement, accessible web design, and planning and performance reporting against this standard.

This requirement also aligns with the _Policy on Service and Digital_’s requirement for departments to provide internal activities by requiring that these learning opportunities be available for all employees.

## Planning and performance reporting

### Plan for service and digital aligns with accessibility plan

<table class="table table-bordered">

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

According to the _[Policy on Service and Digital](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603)_, deputy heads are responsible for approving a three‑year departmental plan for service and digital.
