## Purpose

Collaborate on the creation of a platform to centralize Government of Canada (<abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>) information on accessibility.

The [Access Working Group (AWG)](/en/about/workinggroups/awg/) would like to enable interdepartmental centralization and sharing of accessibility information produced by <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> departments in a central repository sharing space and in <a href="https://canada-ca.github.io/Open_First_Whitepaper/">the open</a>.

2. Provide recommendations for the creation of the accessibility resources and work from Government of Canada (<abbr>GC</abbr>) central repository;
3. Supporting the implementation through various phases of work; and
4. Discussion and initiate supporting activities to identify which information / materials would be appropriate to share.
