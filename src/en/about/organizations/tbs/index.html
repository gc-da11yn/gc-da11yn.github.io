description: Our vision is to make Canada’s public service the most accessible and inclusive in the world. Our work is in setting the conditions for the public service of Canada to identify, prevent, and remove barriers to participation for persons with disabilities. Our strategy is a roadmap to prepare the public service to lead by example and become a model of accessibility for others, in Canada and abroad.

		<p>The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) is committed to building accessible and inclusive services. Building accessible services means meeting the needs of as many people as possible. From the start, we work with the people who will use a product, including people with disabilities. We are working across all disciplines — blurring the lines between research, development, design, and accessibility.</p>
