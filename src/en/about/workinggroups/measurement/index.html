	<h2>What is ICT?</h2>
	<p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is an umbrella term that refers to all technologies including tools, equipment, or an interconnected system that is used by someone to create, convert, acquire, store, analyse, manage, transmit, receive, or broadcast data or information. In the context of the ICT Accessibility Standard, accessible ICT refers to the ability to access and use ICT, regardless of one&rsquo;s level of ability. An official definition of ICT is provided in the draft ICT Accessibility Standard.</p>
	<p>As ICT continues to emerge and evolve, the Government of Canada (GC) wants to ensure that <em>all </em>Canadians can use its ICT.</p>

	<h2>ICT Accessibility Standard</h2>
	<p>Our draft ICT Accessibility Standard will replace the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=23601"><em>Web Accessibility Standard</em></a> and will harmonize with the <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf"><em>EU Accessibility Standard (EN 301 549)</em></a>. We are harmonizing our standard with the EN 301 549 to provide a framework of updating accessibility requirements overtime. This harmonization also helps Canada become and remain a leader in ICT accessibility on the global stage and to simplify ICT trade with Europe.</p>
	<p>In general, the standard will require government organizations to identify, remove and prevent accessibility barriers to new, existing and future ICT.</p>

	<h2>Our Goal:</h2>
	<p>The goal of this project is to deliver on the commitment under Goal 3 &ldquo;Making ICT usable by all&rdquo; of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/diversity-inclusion-public-service/accessibility-public-service/accessibility-strategy-public-service-toc.html">Accessibility Strategy for the Public Service</a>&nbsp;to design and implement a standard to identify, remove and prevent ICT accessibility barriers across the Government of Canada. The project contributes to the Strategy&rsquo;s vision that all ICT in the GC can be independently accessed and used by employees and the public, regardless of one&rsquo;s abilities or disabilities.</p>
	<p>By consulting with subject matter experts, persons with disabilities and the general public, we hope to design a holistic standard that will guide the Government of Canada into a barrier-free future.</p>
