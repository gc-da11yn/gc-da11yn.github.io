title: Measurement of Accessible Information and communications technology (ICT)
layout: layouts/base.njk
description: This section follows the journey of departments and agencies’ combined efforts to create a Government of Canada scorecard and standard for accessible Information and communications technology (ICT).

<h2>What is ICT?</h2>
<p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) refers to all technologies including technology, equipment, or an interconnected system that is used by someone (a user) to create, convert, acquire, store, analyse, manage, transmit, receive, or broadcast data or information. In the context of the WG, accessible ICT refers to the accessibility of ICT for users with disabilities.</p>
<h2>ICT Standard</h2>
<p>The proposed ICT Accessibility Standard will replace the Web Accessibility Standard and will harmonize with the EU Accessibility Standard (EN 301 549). In general, the standard will require government organizations to identify, remove and prevent accessibility barriers to existing and future ICT.</p>
<h2>Project Goal:</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to deliver on the commitment under Goal 3 &ldquo;Making ICT usable by all&rdquo; of the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/diversity-inclusion-public-service/accessibility-public-service/accessibility-strategy-public-service-toc.html">Accessibility Strategy for the Public Service</a> to design and implement a standard to identify, remove and prevent ICT accessibility barriers across the Government of Canada. The project contributes to the Strategy&rsquo;s vision that all ICT in the GC can be independently accessed and used by employees and the public, regardless of one&rsquo;s abilities or disabilities.</p>
<p>By consulting with subject matter experts, persons with disabilities and the general public, we hope to design a holistic standard that will guide the Government of Canada into a barrier-free future.</p>
<p>This project is led by <a href="mailto:arvind.srivastava@tbs-sct.gc.ca">Arvind Srivastava (Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat)</a> and <a href="mailto:melissa.smith@canada.ca">Melissa Smith (Shared Services Canada)</a>.</p>
<h2>ICT Scorecard</h2>
<p>A scorecard is a tool used to measure the accessibility of all ICT in the Government of Canada. Along with the standard, the scorecard will help identify, prevent and remove barriers to accessible ICT for persons with disabilities in the public service.</p>
<h2>Project Goal:</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to deliver on the commitment under Goal 3 of the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/diversity-inclusion-public-service/accessibility-public-service/accessibility-strategy-public-service-toc.html">Accessibility Strategy for the Public Service </a>to develop a scorecard that measures the accessibility of all Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) used by federal public servants. The project contributes to the Strategy&rsquo;s vision that all ICT in the GC can be independently used by employees, regardless of ability or disability.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to create a scorecard and collect data on the accessibility of ICT in the GC. To facilitate this, an Interdepartmental Working Group for the Measurement of Accessible Information and Communication Technologies is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying best practices</li>
<li>Engaging stakeholders and</li>
<li>Developing a measurement approach and methodology.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project is led by Sara Minaeian (Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat) and Kateri Clark (Shared Services Canada).</p>
<h2>How to Get Involved</h2>
<p>We want to hear from you!</p>
<p>Are you an Accessibility Expert, Policy Wonk, or IT Specialist? Or, do you have lived experience with disability and want to provide your perspective? Here is how you can provide your feedback:</p>
<h3>Draft ICT Accessibility Standard</h3>
<p>(TBD)</p>
<h3>Theory of Change</h3>
<p>This Theory of Change identifies the theory of -- the idea behind -- <strong>how</strong> and <strong>why</strong> we are working toward inclusive and accessible ICT within the GC. This Theory of Change identifies the theory of how and why inclusive and accessible ICT could happen within the GC. This model describes what actions would theoretically need to be taken to reach the desired accessible ICT goals, the expected behaviours that would come from taking those actions, and the expected impact.</p>
<p>To recap, we are working toward change, based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the accessible ICT goals of <em><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/diversity-inclusion-public-service/accessibility-public-service/accessibility-strategy-public-service-toc/progress-report-implementation-nothing-without-us-2019-20.html">Nothing Without Us: An Accessibility Strategy for the Government of Canada</a></em> and</li>
<li>the <em><a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603">Policy on Service and Digital</a></em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a Theory of Change model is an essential part of developing the ICT accessibility scorecard. The Theory of Change will guide us, ensuring that the scorecard will only ask questions relevant to the desired project goals, of ICT accessibility measurement.</p>
