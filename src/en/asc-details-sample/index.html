<summary>Indigenous Communities and Federal Accessibility Standards: A Situational Review</summary>
<div class="details-wrapper">
<section class="alert alert-success">
<p><strong>This research project is completed.</strong></p>
</section>
<h3>Who is leading this research?</h3>
<p>First Nations National Building Officers Association</p>
<h3>What is the goal of this study?</h3>
<p>This study will look at how programs and services aimed at removing barriers for people with disabilities can be improved in Indigenous communities.</p>
<h3>Why does this study matter?</h3>
<p>This study will provide a better understanding of Indigenous perspectives on disability and accessibility. This knowledge can then be applied to future standards.</p>
<h3>What are the key findings?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Few studies exist on the barriers faced by people with disabilities living in Indigenous communities.</li>
<li>Many public buildings in Indigenous communities were not designed to be accessible. This is especially true for older buildings.</li>
<li>Designing public space in Indigenous communities needs to involve people from the community, especially people with disabilities.</li>

<summary>Recommendations for Evacuating Individuals with Disabilities from the Built Environment</summary>

<section class="alert alert-success">
<p><strong>This research project is completed.</strong></p>
</section>
<h3>Who is leading this research?</h3>
<p>University Health Network</p>
<h3>What is the goal of this study?</h3>
<p>This study will identify best practices for evacuating people with disabilities from any type of building. It will also include creating a tool to assess the readiness of a building to evacuate people with disabilities.</p>
<h3>Why does this study matter?</h3>
<p>It is important to plan ahead to ensure people with all types of disabilities can be evacuated safely from buildings. This can save lives.</p>
<h3>What are the key findings?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Egressibility is a measure of how easy or difficult it is to exit a building. Egressibility for people with disabilities in an emergency is an issue that has been largely overlooked.</li>
<li>Most egressibility guidelines focus only on evacuating during a fire. However, they need to include a range of possible emergencies that require different responses.</li>
<li>Many solutions exist that can overcome barriers to egressibility.</li>
<li>Knowledge on how to safely evacuate people with disabilities needs to be shared with building staff, developers, and end users.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who is leading this research?</h3>
<p>McMaster University</p>
<h3>What is the goal of this study?</h3>
<p>This study will review the most recent and relevant information on accessibility in the built environment for people with all types of disabilities. It will also identify existing barriers.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why does this study matter?</h3>
<p>The built environment needs to consider the accessibility requirements of people with all types of disabilities. This will ensure that all people with disabilities can access and move around the built environment.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What are the key findings?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Accessibility standards and guidelines have a heavy focus on physical disabilities. They rarely consider intellectual, cognitive, and sensory disabilities.</li>
<li>Education is key to understanding disabilities and creating an accessible built environment.</li>
<li>Research needs to focus on all types of disabilities. It needs to consider solutions for people with different types of disabilities.</li>
