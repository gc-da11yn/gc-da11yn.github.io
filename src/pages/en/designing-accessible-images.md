## The purpose of images

**Informative images:** Images that graphically represent concepts and information, typically pictures, photos and illustrations. The text alternative should be at least a short description conveying the essential information presented by the image.

**Decorative images:** Provide a null text alternative (`alt=""`) when the only purpose of an image is to add visual decoration to the page, rather than to convey information that it is important to understanding the page.

- If it is for decorative purposes, we use `alt=""` or CSS.
- If it is for informative purposes, but does it add new info?
  - If not, it is for decorative purposes. We use `alt=""` or CSS.
  - If yes, what kind of info does it add?
- If it is for actionable purposes, we use `alt="\[label for the link\]`".
- If it is for emotional or simple purposes, we use `alt="\[description\]`".
- If it is for complex purposes, we use `alt="\[short description + location of the long description\]`".
