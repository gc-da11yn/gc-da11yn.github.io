		<h2 class="h3">Policy, Priorities, and Partnership team</h2>
The Canada School of Public Service (CSPS) Policy, Priorities, and Partnership team have been focused on the development of the Accessibility Strategy for the School. As we are on route to creating a Barrier Free Canada by 2040 Government wide, at the School, we are ensuring that all our policy related tools all align with the expected accessibility requirements as defined on the [_Accessibility Act_](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-0.6/). In collaboration with the Future of Work Team, the School’s Diversity, and Inclusion Forum, and the UX Directorate we look forward to working towards achieving current and emerging initiatives in the Accessibility Strategy.

		<h2 class="h3">Future of Work/Employee Experience team</h2>
The CSPS Future of Work / Employee Experience team is working on the creation of the corporate accessibility plan, as required by the [_Accessible Canada Act._](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-0.6/) The plan is based on the current CSPS Accessibility Strategy, while ensuring that the CSPS is compliant with the new technical Accessible Canada Regulations.

The Future of Work team will be coordinating with all CSPS business lines involved in accessibility related policy, both from an employer and service provider standpoint. As well, we will be conducting consultations with employees who identify as Persons with Disabilities during the process of preparation of the accessibility plan which is scheduled to be published prior to December 2022.

		<h2 class="h3">Digital Academy team</h2>
The CSPS Digital Academy was established by the Canada School of Public Service (CSPS) in 2018 to help federal public servants gain the knowledge, skills and mindsets they need in the digital age. It supports the principles of Canada's Beyond2020 initiative for an agile, inclusive and equipped workforce and advocates for a digital-first approach that aligns with [Canada's Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html). These ten digital standards form the foundation of the government's shift to becoming more agile, open and user focused. One of the Digital Standards is to **build in accessibility from the start**. The CSPS Digital Academy endeavors to do this in our work, and we co-create content to support other public servants in doing the same.
