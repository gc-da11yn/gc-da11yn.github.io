## Introduction

The purpose of the PDF Accessibility Checklist is to support Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) PDF document developers ensure that accessibility compliance meets the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) standards. Please note that the checklist only contains WCAG criteria that are related to the most common errors identified in PDF documents.

We established a list of tools and resources to help developers verify their document accessibility, as well as the PDF Accessibility Checklist that identifies 27 success criteria that are pertinent to PDFs.

## Tools and Resources
