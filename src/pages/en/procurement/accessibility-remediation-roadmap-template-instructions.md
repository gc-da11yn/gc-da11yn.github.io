## Purpose of the accessibility remediation roadmap template

This Accessibility Remediation Roadmap (Roadmap) template has been developed by SSC to address known Information and Communication Technology (ICT) accessibility deficiencies. Government of Canada Technical Authorities / Business Owners can use this template as is, modify it, or decide not to use it.

The template outlines the essential information the Government of Canada would expect in an Accessibility Remediation Roadmap to understand and address deficiencies listed in an Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR). It serves as a guide for understanding:

- The current accessibility issues and
- The timelines and plans for resolving these issues.

This Accessibility Remediation Roadmap template is designed primarily for use in procurements or projects where accessibility conformance is required. Use the template to complete all necessary sections, adding any additional details or relevant sections to the Accessibility Remediation Roadmap, as needed.

### Important notes

- Testing for Conformance: Before creating an Accessibility Remediation Roadmap, the Good or Service must be tested for conformance to the target accessibility standard to identify areas of nonconformance. The results are recorded in the Accessibility Conformance Report.
- Requirements for Conformance: The requirement for conformance to the target accessibility standard and level of detail for the Accessibility Remediation Roadmap will be outlined in the solicitation and/or contract.
- Accessible Format: Both the Accessibility Conformance Report and the Accessibility Remediation Roadmap must be created in an accessible format.
- Contractual Obligations: If this template is used to fulfill contractual requirements, ensure it is adapted to provide all required information as per the contract terms.

## How to use the accessibility remediation roadmap template

Inline Instructions

- Rather than providing detailed instructions here, guidance has been integrated directly into the template. Inline instructions are marked with [Action Item - square brackets].
- Follow these instructions to complete each section of the Accessibility Remediation Roadmap.

### Target accessibility standard

As of January 2025, the Government of Canada is implementing the [CAN/ASC – EN 301 549:2024](https://accessible.canada.ca/en-301-549-accessibility-requirements-ict-products-and-services-1) / [EN 301 549 V3.2.1 (2021-03)<small> (<abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>, 2.3 <abbr title="Megabite">MB</abbr>)</small>](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf).

The [CAN/ASC - EN 301 549:2024](https://accessible.canada.ca/en-301-549-accessibility-requirements-ict-products-and-services-1) standard is Accessible Standards Canada’s adoption of the [EN 301 549 - V3.2.1 (2021-03)<small> (<abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>, 2.3 <abbr title="Megabite">MB</abbr>)</small>](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf) as a national standard of Canada and is identical to the official version released by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). The CAN/ASC - EN 301 549:2024 accessibility standard is available in HTML format in both English and French.

This template can be used for subsequent versions of the EN 301 549 and/or other ICT accessibility standards. The Government of Canada will advise the applicable ICT accessibility standard that conformance is requested for.

### Good / service accessibility conformance overview

[Action Item - Provide a brief summary of the current accessibility status of the Good / Service. Indicate if there are any known groups of users who may experience some barriers, e.g. screen reader users.]

### Accessibility inclusion plan

[Action Item - Outline your organization’s approach to improving the accessibility of the Good / Service. This generally should include:

- Plans for regular accessibility testing.
- Accessibility integration into the design and development of any new Good / Service features.
- Integration of accessibility testing into development processes.
- Any initiatives to test with users, or to facilitate gathering accessibility specific feedback from end users.
- Outline how accommodations and workarounds will be provided to users until full remediation is achieved.

The intention for this section is to clearly communicate strategies to address the conformance of the Good / Service on an ongoing basis.]

### Known technical limitations

[Action Item - If applicable, indicate any key technical limitations of the current solutions implementation, such as frameworks, platforms, integrations or technologies which may limit the current solution from reaching full conformance to the target accessibility standard. Please also provide, if any, plans to address these limitations.]

#### Notes

[Action Item - Add any other notes or comments which the reader (the GC Functional Product Owner) should be aware of. For example:

- software upgrade options that would resolve accessibility issues;
- plans to subcontract accessibility audits and remediation.]

#### Priority definitions

[Action Item - If this Roadmap is going to be providing priorities to determine remediation timeframes, consider using the below definition as a starting point and adjust as needed. If the Roadmap does not use a priority rating to define timelines, then this column of the Accessibility Remediation Roadmap Details table can be removed.]

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Priority</th>

<tr>
<td>Critical</td>
<td>This accessibility issue results in inaccessible content or substantial barriers for individuals with disabilities. Until a solution is implemented, content will be completely inaccessible. Requires immediate remediation.</td>
<td>[Action Item - Remediation should be a top priority.]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>High</td>
<td>This accessibility issue results in serious barriers for individuals with disabilities. Until a solution is implemented, some content will be inaccessible. Users relying on Assistive Technology will experience significant frustration when attempting to access content.</td>
<td>[Action Item - Remediation should be a priority.]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Moderate</td>
<td>This accessibility issue results in some barriers for individuals with disabilities but would not prevent them from accessing fundamental functionalities, elements or content. This issue must be resolved before the solution can be considered fully compliant.</td>
<td>[Action Item - Remediation should be a reasonable priority.]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Low</td>
<td>This is considered an accessibility issue that yields less impact for users than a moderate issue. For a solution to be considered fully compliant, this accessibility issue must be resolved, but can be dealt with last.</td>
<td>[Action Item - Remediation should be the lowest priority.]</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Known issues

[Action Item - Fill out the Roadmap Details table with as much information as you can to help the reader understand the nature of each known issue and how and when it will be remediated. You can also list user issues / barriers that are not related to conformance. Depending on the number of issues that you are recording, you can consider representing this data in a separate spreadsheet as it is not uncommon for some larger products to have hundreds to thousands of known issues.]

### Notes

- The Sample Accessibility Remediation Roadmap Details Table has been prefilled with three sample issues which must be removed when you provide your Roadmap.
- EN indicates the EN 301 549 - V3.2.1 (2021-03) clause. It is recommended to link it to the proper clause in the standard. Roadmap creators can use either the reference to the EN 301 549 - V3.2.1 (2021-03) clause (e.g. EN 9.1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)) or the equivalent reference to the CAN/ASC - EN 301 549:2024 clause (e.g. CAN/ASC 9.1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)).
