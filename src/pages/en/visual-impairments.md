## Low Vision

<dl>
  <dt>Definition:</dt>
  <dd>
Low vision is uncorrectable vision loss that interferes with daily activities. It is better defined in terms of function, rather than numerical test results.

- In other words, low vision is “not enough vision to do whatever it is you need to do,” which can vary from person to person.
- Most eye care professionals prefer to use the term “low vision” to describe permanently reduced vision that cannot be corrected with regular glasses, contact lenses, medicine, or surgery.
