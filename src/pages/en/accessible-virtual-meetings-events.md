Virtual meetings and events come in various formats and sizes â€“ from small workshops with participants who know each other to large public meetings you are planning. It is critical to ensure meetings and events are fully accessible from accessing them, to the presentations. By planning ahead, you can build accessibility into all aspects of the meeting. This will allow everyone to participate fully, including people with disabilities.
