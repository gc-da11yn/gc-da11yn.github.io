## Purpose

The purpose of this task force is to collaborate on the creation of a structured platform to centralize Government of Canada (<abbr>GC</abbr>) information on accessibility.

The Access Working Group (<abbr>AWG</abbr>) would like to enable interdepartmental centralization and sharing of accessibility information produced by <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> departments in a central repository and sharing space.

Sharing accessibility resources and work in a central repository would, among other benefits:

- enable <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> employees better access to centralized information relating to accessibility;
- create a space to collaborate between departments in the open;
- reduce time and money spent duplicating or searching for other <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> departments accessibility work; and
- promote the accessibility work that we do in the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> on a public space.

## Key role

The Digital Accessibility Toolkit (<abbr>DAT</abbr>) task force supports the Public Service Accessibility Strategy [Goal 3: Technology Make information and communications technology usable by all](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/diversity-inclusion-public-service/accessibility-public-service/accessibility-strategy-public-service-toc/accessibility-strategy-public-service-technology.html).

This task force will:

1. provide recommendations for creating the Government of Canada (<abbr>GC</abbr>) central repository for <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> created accessibility resources and work;
2. support the implementation through various phases of work; and
3. discuss and initiate supporting activities to identify which information / materials would be appropriate to shared.

The Digital Accessibility Toolkit (<abbr>DAT</abbr>) will leverage accessibility expertise across government, showcase best practices, and promote inclusive design and accessible by default.

The key roles will be defined based on the World Wide Web Consortium's (<abbr>W3C</abbr>) [<abbr>ARRM</abbr> Project - Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities Mapping project](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/ARRM_Project_-_Accessibility_Roles_and_Responsibilities_Mapping).

## Reporting structure

Co-chairs will be leaders in the accessibility community within the Government of Canada (<abbr>GC</abbr>). The chair(s) may change over time as appropriate.

The Digital Accessibility Toolkit (<abbr>DAT</abbr>) operates under the umbrella of the Access Working Group (<abbr>AWG</abbr>) and will make periodic reports to that working group.

### Mandate and decision-making authority

The Digital Accessibility Toolkit (<abbr>DAT</abbr>) is a recommendation-making forum that has a mandate to:

- make recommendations for a <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> central repository to share accessibility information created by various <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> departments, minimizing duplication of work across departments

- increase awareness across participating departments through the Access Working Group (<abbr>AWG</abbr>) and Interdepartmental <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> working Group;
- leverage expertise, foster information flow, and broaden knowledge across the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>; and
