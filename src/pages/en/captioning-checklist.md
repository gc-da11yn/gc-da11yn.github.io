# **Captioning Checklist**
Do the captions include:

- Speaker identification for multiple speakers?
- Dialogue and narration?
- Tone and manner of voice, as needed (whispering).
- Important sounds, such as an explosion and a fire alarm.

Are the captions:

- Accurate?
  - Free from grammatical errors?
  - Free from punctuation errors?
- Consistent (uniformity in style and presentation)?
- Clear (A complete textual representation of the audio)?
- Readable:
  - displayed with enough time to be read completely?
  - synchronized and appear at approximately the same time as the audio is delivered?
  - not obscured by, nor do they obscure the visual content?
  - Have enough colour contrast (4.5 to 1 for small-scale text, 3:1 for large-scale text) between the video and the captions?
- Equal:
  - the meaning and intention of the material is completely preserved?
