## Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams is the standard meeting platform for virtual meetings.

### Meeting

- [Record a meeting in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/record-a-meeting-in-teams-34dfbe7f-b07d-4a27-b4c6-de62f1348c24)

- Captions are available only in English (US) for now.
- Live captions in French (July 2021)
