#### [Addressing Disability Inclusion and Barriers to Accessibility (INC115) (csps-efpc.gc.ca)](https://catalogue.csps-efpc.gc.ca/product?catalog=INC115&cm_locale=en)

This online self-paced course challenges common assumptions and beliefs about people with disabilities and aims to shift the perspective from the impairment to the barrier.

#### [Disability Management and Workplace Wellness (INC120) (csps-efpc.gc.ca)](https://catalogue.csps-efpc.gc.ca/product?catalog=INC120&cm_locale=en)

This online self-paced course outlines the disability management process for responding to work-related and non-work-related impairments and functional restrictions, including injuries, illnesses, disabilities and other limitations. Participants will learn about the legislative instruments and disability management tools that support workplace wellness for federal government employees, as well as the accommodation measures to consider when creating a remain-at-work or a return-to-work plan.
