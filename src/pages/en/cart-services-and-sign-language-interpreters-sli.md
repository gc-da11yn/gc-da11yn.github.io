Important to consider that people who are culturally Deaf, may prefer to have sign language interpreters because their first language is likely American Sign Language (ASL – English) or Langue des signes québécoise (LSQ), but do not assume this. Ask them what their preferred accommodation would be. Indeed, there are people who have become deaf later in life and have not learned to communicate by ASL or LSQ.

## Communication Access Real-Time (CART)

- CART is a Real-time speech-to-text translation of all spoken words and environmental sounds by a trained CART stenographer. Unlike other forms of captioning, CART aims to capture all sounds and allow the user to decide what information is important to them.
- CART can be provided in English and French.
- Remote CART services are available to provide live captioning online.
- The use of CART requires a computer with high-speed, stable internet access (preferably hardwired) and email access to receive a URL link.
- When booking, include as much information as possible on the event, including:
- The date,
- Start and end time,
- Any prepared materials (e.g. agenda, participant list, speaking notes, frequently used acronyms, etc.).
- Also include information on what you will be using for audio at the event (e.g. conference line and dial-in information; AV team – if an AV team is being used, pass along their information).
- To provide CART services in both languages requires a translation service also being in place for the event.
- Reach out to companies that offer this service and see who is available to support the event as soon as possible. Once a company is found (typically the lowest bidder/quote), you need to provide:
- The teleconference numbers so they can listen to the Simultaneous Interpreters for bilingual events.
- [Microsoft Teams offers Live Captioning](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-live-captions-in-a-teams-meeting-4be2d304-f675-4b57-8347-cbd000a21260) (automated) at no additional cost.
- Available in both English and French.
- While this service is available, it should not be relied on as the only means of getting information as it is can often incorrectly caption speech, and the text disappears quickly.
- It is also restricted to one language at a time, and does not work if speakers are switching between languages.
- CART can be offered from the following service providers. Keep in mind there are costs involved with these service providers;
- [CART from the Canadian Hearing Services](https://www.chs.ca/service/captioning-services) – staff at CHS will be able to provide you with information on the logistics in providing CART for audio conferences.
- AB Captioning and CART Inc. (contact Sandra German by email at [sandragerman@abccaptioning.com](mailto:sandragerman@abccaptioning.com). They can also be booked by phone at 780-445-4406 and online at [AB Captioning and CART Inc](https://www.abcaptioning.com/book-a-cart-captioner).
- CART from [Sign Language Interpreting Associates Ottawa Inc. (SLIAO)](mailto:https://sliao.ca/services/) (while not necessarily a primary CART provider, they can provide it as part of a larger sign-language service contract).
- Rates vary but expect to pay between $100-$200 per hour, per stenographer/captioner.
- Either a single contract for both English and French services, or two separate contracts from the provider will be required.
- Links to the online event and the simultaneous English/French streams to be provided.
- The CART services company will provide links to the CART output to share with participants.
- Important to ensure that you discuss the possibility of having transcripts from the CART provider. Transcripts must be ordered before the event.
- Transcripts can be a valuable additional service for people with hearing loss. However, if you want to share the transcripts with others, then the CART providers will charge an additional cost because they correct errors the CART stenographer may have made. Unfortunately, if the additional cost for transcripts is not paid, the CART user cannot share the transcripts with others.

## Sign Language Interpreters

SLI are booked two different ways – through the Translation Bureau or external suppliers.

### Translation Bureau

- You can book the Sign Language interpreter by visiting the Translation Bureau’s site [Sign language interpretation and oral transliteration services Internal link<span class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt mrgn-lft-sm mrgn-rght-sm" aria-hidden="true"></span><span class="wb-inv"> Internal link</span>](http://gcintranet.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/bt-tb/interpretation/visuelle-visual-eng.html).
- SLI booked through the Translation Bureau at Public Services and Procurement Canada is at no cost (with some exceptions) however, there may be cancellation fees.
- These are booked as soon as possible, with at minimum 5 business days advance to ensure availability of interpreters.
- Notice of at least **two full working days**must be provided if all or part of the event is cancelled or the dates or times are changed to avoid the Bureau charging for the interpreters’ fees.
