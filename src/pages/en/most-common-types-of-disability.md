# Most Common Types of Disability
Here are some of the most commonly found types of disabilities in the workplace, and their related accessibility considerations.

**Visual Impairments**
Visual disabilities are sensory disabilities that can range from some amount of vision loss, loss of visual acuity, or increased or decreased sensitivity to specific or bright colors, to complete or uncorrectable loss of vision in either or both eyes.

**Mobility, Flexibility, and Body Structure Disabilities**
Mobility impairment includes people with upper or lower limb loss or disability, challenges with manual dexterity, disability in co-ordination with different organs of the body, or with a broken skeletal structure. Physical and mobility disabilities restrict the ability of the body or one or more limbs to move independently and purposefully.

**Auditory Disabilities**
Auditory disabilities are sensory disabilities that range from partial to complete hearing loss.

**Cognitive Disabilities*

Cognitive impairments take many forms, including short and long-term memory impairments, and perceptual differences. Language impairments, including dyslexia and temporary impairments associated with those trying to learn new languages, are also common cognitive problems.
