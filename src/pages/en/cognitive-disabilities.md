## Intellectual Disabilities

<dl>
<dt>Definition:</dt>
<dd>

Intellectual disability is characterized by significant limitations both in intellectual functioning (reasoning, learning, problem solving) and in adaptive behavior, which covers a range of everyday social and practical skills.

According to the American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, an individual has intellectual disability if they meet three criteria:

* Their IQ is below 70 to 75
* There are significant limitations in two or more adaptive areas (skills that are needed to live, work, and play in the community, such as communication or selfcare)
* The condition manifests itself before the age of 18

</dd>
<dt>Characteristics:</dt>
<dd>

People with an intellectual disability may:

* Sit up, crawl, or walk later than other children
* Learn to talk later or have trouble understanding and speaking
* Find it hard to remember things
* Have trouble understanding social rules and cues
* Have trouble seeing the results of their actions
* Have trouble solving problems and decision-making

</dd>

## Reading and Dyslexia

<dl>
<dt>Definition:</dt>
<dd>

Dyslexia is a learning disability that impairs a person’s ability to read. The disability could be the result of a congenital difference, an injury, delayed development, a neurological or physical disability. Professionals identify and diagnose specific reading disabilities, such as Dyslexia in children and teenagers. Often the diagnosis of a learning disability will include components of a reading impairment.

People with adult-onset dyslexia typically develop after a brain injury or in the context of dementia. Recent research has shown a number of genes that may predispose a person to developing dyslexia. Dyslexia can be inherited in some families.

</dd>
<dt>Characteristics:</dt>
<dd>

Although the disorder differs from person to person, reading disabilities may include:

* An inability to perceive text or to process the meaning of words, phrases and ideas
* Read at lower levels than expected despite having normal intelligence
* Difficulty with phonological processing (the manipulation of sounds), spelling, and / or rapid visual-verbal responding

</dd>
</dl>

## Math and Computation

<dl>
<dt>Definition:</dt>
<dd>Math and computational disabilities impact a person’s ability to learn and communicate math. Dyscalculia involves an inability to understand arithmetic and how to calculate. This disability can be complicated by dysgraphia, an inability to draw or copy figures and graphs, and by anxiety. Dyscalculia may be congenital or result from an injury, disease, or aging.</dd>
<dt>Characteristics:</dt>
<dd>

According to Understood’s What is Dyscalculia and other sources, common signs of dyscalculia include difficulty with:

* Grasping the meaning of quantities or concepts like biggest vs smallest
* Word problems that require math skills
* Understanding that the numeral 4 is the same as the word four, and that these both mean four items
* Basic math concepts, such as addition, subtraction, multiplying, and dividing
* Remembering math facts, such as multiplication tables
* Math operations, such as such as carrying, borrowing, and regrouping
* Time and money, such as estimating time, counting money and making change
* Spatial reasoning, such as judging speed or distance
* Sequences of numbers, such as phone numbers and addresses

</dd>
</dl>




## Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder

<dl>
<dt>Definition:</dt>
<dd>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects both children and adults. Symptoms usually appear by age 7. While people do not outgrow ADHD, they do learn to adapt. ADHD is characterized by difficulties with attention, impulsivity and hyperactivity that can interfere with daily functioning and relationships.</dd>
<dt>Characteristics:</dt>
<dd>

The main symptoms of ADHD are:

* Inattention: difficulty focusing, forgetfulness, distractibility and disorganization
* Impulsivity: acting without thinking, interrupting others and difficulty waiting for one’s turn
* Hyperactivity: fidgeting, restlessness, excessive talking, and inability to sit still

</dd>
</dl>

## Autism Spectrum Disorders

<dl>
<dt>Definition:</dt>
<dd>

According to the World Health Organization: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) refers to a range of conditions marked by some degree of impairment in social behaviour, communication and language, and a narrow range of interests and activities that are both unique to the individual and carried out repetitively.

ASD begins in childhood and tends to continue into adolescence and adulthood. People with ASD often have co-occurring conditions, such as epilepsy, depression, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The level of intellectual functioning in individuals with ASDs is extremely variable, extending from profound impairment to superior levels.

</dd>
<dt>Characteristics:</dt>
<dd>

People with ASD may exhibit some of the following traits:

* Difficulty with social interaction: making and maintaining relationships, understanding social cues, and understanding or talking about feelings
* Communication difficulties: using and understanding language, making eye contact, giving unrelated answers to questions and repeating words or phrases over and over
* Difficulty with change, such as getting upset by minor changes
* Narrow interests, such as having obsessive interests
* Repetitive behaviour, such as flap their hands or lining up objects
* Unusual motor movements, such as flap their hands and rock their body
* Sensory sensitivities: unusual reactions to the way things sound, smell, taste, look, or feel

</dd>
</dl>

## Non-verbal Learning Disability

<dl>
<dt>Definition:</dt>
<dd>According to the University of Michigan, Michigan Medicine resource, Your Child Development and Behavior Resources, Non-verbal Learning Disability (NLD): Nonverbal Learning Disability is very much like Asperger Syndrome (AS), in which people with the syndrome have normal intelligence and language development, but have trouble with social skills, sensory input, and making transitions. AS and NLD are generally thought to describe the same kind of disorder but to differ in severity, with AS describing more severe symptoms.</dd>
<dt>Characteristics:</dt>
<dd>

Some of the signs of NLD include:

* Great vocabulary, verbal expression and reading comprehension
* Excellent memory recall for details
* Attention to detail, but missing the big picture
* Poor abstract reasoning and problem solving
* Difficulty reading maps, interpreting graphs, and solving puzzles and time management
* Difficulty with planning, organizing, and managing tasks
* Physical awkwardness, poor coordination
* Poor social skills
* Trouble understanding social cues, body language, sarcasm and humour
* Trouble adjusting to changes
* Anxiety, depression, low self-esteem

</dd>
</dl>
