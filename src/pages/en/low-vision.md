## Information and Awareness on Accessibility Topics

The IT Accessibility Office offers awareness services. We provide information on accessibility related matters.

People with low vision have a decreased ability to see. This impairment is to a degree that cannot be corrected by usual means, such as glasses. It can affect various aspects of daily life, including work. There exists an assortment of hardware, software and tools to amend these afflictions and help those who have low vision, some examples are:

- User interface scaling to larger easier to identify sizes on Windows and Mac
- Software to enhance and scale user interface beyond operating system limitations
- Physical computer addons to magnify the monitor

CCTV Magnifiers

known as a CCTV (Closed Circuit Television) or as a Video Magnifier, these are generally a combination of a customized camera, mount arm for steady hands-free positioning of the camera, a viewing screen/monitor, lenses with the ability to zoom (in some cases up to 82x magnification), and viewing modes with lighting, color, and contrast modes for optimal visual assistance. There is often a viewing platform, which allows easy positioning of the magnified item, book, or image.
