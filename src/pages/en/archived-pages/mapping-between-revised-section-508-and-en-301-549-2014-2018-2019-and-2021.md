The previous version of this mapping document, which compared the Revised Section 508 with EN 301 549 standards (2014, 2018, 2019, and 2021 editions), has been withdrawn. We identified significant issues in the content and have removed it while we determine how best to proceed.

We are currently reassessing the structure and accuracy of this resource. If we move forward with a revised version, it will focus exclusively on the Revised Section 508 and the most recent versions of EN 301 549 (2021 and 2025, once officially published).

This decision was made in alignment with internal accessibility teams, and the document has also been removed from GCPedia and the Shared Services Canada (SSC) SharePoint site.

We recommend removing any bookmarks or links you may have to this page, as the previous content is no longer available or accurate. If a new version is published, a link will be shared in the [Latest updates]({{ pathPrefix }}/en/#updates) section on our homepage.

In the meantime, we encourage you to refer directly to the official standards for the most current guidance:

- [Revised Section 508 Standards (U.S.)](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/)
- [CAN/ASC - EN 301 549:2024 Accessibility requirements for ICT products and services (EN 301 549:2021, IDT)](https://accessible.canada.ca/creating-accessibility-standards/canasc-en-301-5492024-accessibility-requirements-ict-products-and-services)

We appreciate your understanding. This page will be updated if and when a new version of the mapping document becomes available.
