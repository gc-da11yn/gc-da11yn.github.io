   - Providing input and expertise on the development of Web standards and guidelines adopted by the GC.
   - Providing advice on GC-wide initiatives and policies affecting persons with disabilities.
2. In its role as a working group providing expertise and independent review the AWG would be responsible to:
   - Leverage the expertise of AWG members and Adaptive Computer Technology facilities for review and/or user testing on priority projects. Results and recommendations would be compiled by the AWG.
   - Collaborate with the other working groups to ensure that accessibility requirements are incorporated in their advice, recommendation, etc.
   - Report regularly on the work plans of the AWG and to report on the status of deliverables.

## Membership Criteria

Membership on the Access Working Group is open to all federal civil servants. Each member must be appointed by a manager at their organization, who is at the EX minus 1 level or higher.

To ensure continuity and stability of involvement, discussion, and information flow, substitutions are discouraged; however, each member may appoint an alternate who will be empowered to fully participate in the Access Working Group’s work in place of the regular member.

The AWG with the prior approval of the Chair(s) of the parent committee, may invite membership above and beyond the membership criteria and retain such assistance and direct such work as may be necessary to facilitate its work. Membership in the AWG could change, as work items are completed and new ones are undertaken.

Members are expected to:

- Attend meetings on a regular basis. To remain a member, a representative cannot miss 2 meetings in a row, without prior notice and a valid justification.
- Participate in the working groups activities and projects. This may include reviewing documentation such as standards, guidelines, best practices, doing accessibility testing, and providing feedback and recommendations. Members are expected to contribute a minimum of 10% of their time to the activities and projects of the working group. This is 2-3 days per month. Any member that does not contribute in any way, in a six-consecutive month period will become an observer.
