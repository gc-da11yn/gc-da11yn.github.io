## Roles

The Access Working Group has two essential roles: as an advisory body and as a working group providing expertise and independent review for the TBS, the Web Manager’s Council and Web Renewal Initiative.

1.  In its role as an advisory body, the AWG would improve the accessibility of GC-Wide Web Based information and services by:
    - Assisting TBS and the WMC identify Web Accessibility Issues and priorities for persons with disabilities and identify unresolved Web Accessibility Issues.
    - Providing input and expertise on the development of Web standards and guidelines adopted by the GC.
    - Providing advice on GC-wide initiatives and policies affecting persons with disabilities.
2.  In its role as a working group providing expertise and independent review the AWG would be responsible to:
    - Leverage the expertise of AWG members and Adaptive Computer Technology facilities for review and/or user testing on priority projects. Results and recommendations would be compiled by the AWG.
    - Collaborate with the other working groups to ensure that accessibility requirements are incorporated in their advice, recommendation, etc.
    - Report regularly on the work plans of the AWG and to report on the status of deliverables.
