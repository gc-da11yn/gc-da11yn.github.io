# **Live Broadcasts**
Live Broadcasts are defined as a facilitator presenting a PowerPoint via videoconference. Below we have defined each type and their respective accessibility requirements.

## **Live video - Facilitator is presenting with a PowerPoint deck in the background**
- Facilitator should read everything on the PowerPoint being presented.
- Live caption is recommended for a live event. A cleaned-up version including proper wording, grammar, and punctuation of the live transcript must be made available**.**
- Create an [accessible version of PowerPoint](https://a11y.canada.ca/en/guides/office365/accessible-powerpoint-documents-365/). If the presenter says each word on each slide, this can be skipped, but not recommended.
- If the event is recorded, the same rules apply as above under “Recorded Presentation”.
- Sign Language is not required.

## **Live Event Broadcasts**
- Live real-time captioning (visible to users) is recommended, but **not** mandatory, for a live event. A cleaned-up version including proper wording, grammar, and punctuation of the live transcript must be made available.
- If the event is recorded, the same rules apply as above under “Recorded Presentation”.
