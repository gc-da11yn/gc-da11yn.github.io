AAACT's services and solutions help the public service to serve all Canadians, including those with disabilities. Our expertise in accessible digital content ensures GC products and services are available to everyone. We offer training, tools and testing services to help departments create accessible digital content that is inclusive by design such as documents, presentations and web content.

For public servants with disabilities or injuries, AAACT offers a wide range of adaptive computer technologies, tools, training, services and resources. Our programs and support help users explore, experiment, and learn about adaptive solutions and collaborative workplaces. We create individual workplans that allow public servants to work collaboratively in a safe, accessible and productive environment

AAACT serves all GC employees and departments, in person and remotely, in various types of work arrangements.
