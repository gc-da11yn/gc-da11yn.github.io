## Information and Awareness on Accessibility Topics

The term "hearing impaired" describes people with any degree of hearing loss. This ranges from hard of hearing to complete deafness.

### Definition of various levels of hearing loss

Deaf

Refers to a person with hearing loss so severe that there is very little or no functional hearing.

Deafened

Usually refers to a person who becomes deaf as an adult.

Hard-of-hearing

Refers to a person with hearing loss where there may be enough residual hearing that an auditory device, such as a hearing aid or a frequency-modulation system, provides adequate assistance to process speech.

Some people also may have overly sensitive hearing (Hyperacusis) in one or both ears.
