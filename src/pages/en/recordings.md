## **Recorded Presentation – Audio Only (without a seen presenter)**
- A recorded presentation becomes a video, so it must follow the same rules as all time-based media, meaning the following are required:
  - Transcript.
  - Captioning.
  - Audio Description.
  - Keyboard Access.
- If a document or presentation is being used during the recording:
  - An accessible version of the supporting documentation (PPT, DOC, etc.) must be created. If the presenter says each word on each slide, this step can be skipped, however, it is **highly recommended** that an accessible version be made available to all users as a best practice.
  - At this time, Audio description (describing (during natural pauses in the dialogue) what is happening on the screen) is not required **unless it concerns Health and Safety for citizens.** 

## **Recorded Standard Video – With a Visible Facilitator**
- Create an [accessible version of PowerPoint](https://a11y.canada.ca/en/guides/office365/accessible-powerpoint-documents-365/). If the presenter says each word on each slide, this can be skipped, but not recommended.
- Provide closed captioning of what the presenter says and include descriptive text for all relevant and important actions and/or sounds.
- Provide a written transcript of what was said and include descriptive text of all **relevant and important** sounds and/or actions.
