# Create accessible presentations in PowerPoint
Version 1.3 | March 2024

## Slide Master
As much as possible, format your slides using the **Slide Master** tab. To open this tab, select:
1.	**View tab**
2.	**Master Views** group (if necessary)
3.	**Slide Master**.

When existing slide layouts do not meet your needs, add a new layout. Select the **Insert Layout**, then add **Content** placeholders as needed with the **Insert Placeholder**.

**Avoid** adding content from the **Insert** tab.

## Pasting text
When pasting content from another source:
1.	place cursor in desired location
2.	press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F10</kbd> (or right-click)
3.	press <kbd>T</kbd> (or under **Paste options**, select **Keep Text Only**).

To insert a layout from the **Slide Master** tab, select:
1.	**Edit Master** group (if necessary)
2.	**Insert Layout**.

To add a placeholder from the **Slide Master** tab, select:
1.	**Master Layout** group (if necessary)
2.	**Insert Placeholder** menu
3.	Specify your placeholder type.

**Warning**: Every slide layout must include a Title placeholder and content placeholder. Do not use the slide number placeholders. To add slide numbers, select **Slide Master** tab, then a **Slide layout**. Select Insert tab > **Text** Box. Type "Slide ". Select **Insert** tab > **Text** group > **Slide Number**. Type "of" and then the total number of slides. Copy this text box to the slide layouts in your presentation. It's best to add the slide numbers after finalizing your presentation.

## Slide titles
Every slide must have a **unique** slide title. If content continues onto the next slide, add “(1 of 2)” to the end of the title.

## Fonts and sizing
Use **sans serif** fonts (such as **Arial**) instead of serif fonts (such as **Times New Roman**). Title font size of 24 pt or greater and body font size of 18 pt or greater.

## Formatting text
**Use left alignment** for your text content. Avoid using justified text.

To increase spacing between lines of text use the **Paragraph** dialogue box’s **Before**, **After** and **Line Spacing fields**. **Do not** press the **Enter** key to add extra spacing.

## Links
**Always** use meaningful link text so your reader knows where the link takes them like “<u>Shared Services Canada</u>”; instead of “Click here”.
Printed PowerPoint presentations must also display the URL.

## Images
All images require descriptive alternative text (Alt Text). It must convey the meaning of the image. If an image is decorative, type “Decorative”.

To access the **Alt Text** panel:
1.	select the image
2.	press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F10</kbd> (or right-click)
3.	select **View Alt Text**.

Complex images (like graphs and charts) require an alternative text and a long description containing all the image information, such as data and trends.

**Things to avoid :**:
- images of text;
- SmartArt;
- grouped objects.

## Tables
-	Use tables for data only.
-	Define all tables. Select **Table Design** tab > **Table Style Options** group (if necessary) > **Check** all relevant options. **Header Row** is mandatory.

**Things to avoid :**
-	the **Draw Table** tool
-	screenshots or an image of a table
-	merged or split cells
-	nested tables
-	empty cells
-	non-text objects into cells.

## Media
For **audio** content:
1.	transcriptions are mandatory
2.	subtitles are optional
3.	audio descriptions are optional.

For **video** content:
1.	subtitles are mandatory
2.	audio descriptions are mandatory if some of the information is visual only
3.	transcriptions are mandatory if videos include interactive elements.

**Avoid** using interactive elements, animations and other visual effects.

## Colour and contrast
When adding colours to a presentation, stick to the **Automatic** colour and **Theme Accent** colours. Users can easily reduce barriers by applying custom colours that meet their needs (using **Design** tab > **Variants** group).

Make sure there is sufficient contrast between the text and the background.
Information must be conveyed using more than colour alone. For example, add a border or a different shape.

**Things to avoid :**
-	background images
-	placing text on top of an image.

## Reading order
Reading order is the natural order your eyes would follow when looking at a slide. Make sure the reading order of each slide is correct by clicking just outside the slide, then using the **Tab** key to cycle through the content. This shows what the current order your content is in.

Correct reading order issues in the **Reading Order** pane or in the **Selection** pane (for Office versions older than 365).

## Languages
Specify the proofing language for each slide. Select:
1.	all slide objects (press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>)
2.	**Review** tab
3.	**Language** group (if necessary)
4.	**Language** menu
5.	**Set proofing language**.

Avoid creating bilingual documents, as this reduces their accessibility.

## Accessibility check
To run the accessibility checker, select:
1.	**Review** tab
2.	**Accessibility** group
3.	**Check accessibility**.
4.	Check the **Keep accessibility checker running while I work** option.

The accessibility checker is a great start, but it won’t catch every single issue.

## Presenting
When presenting, describe any important visual elements shown on each slide.

## PowerPoint to PDF
**Note**: Most PDF files are not accessible. When possible, share the PowerPoint presentation. If you must create a PDF version of your presentation:
1.	Press <kbd>Alt</kbd>, <kbd>F</kbd>, <kbd>E</kbd>, <kbd>A</kbd> or select **File** tab > **Export** menu > **Create PDF/XPS Document** submenu > **Create PDF/XPS**.
2.	In the **Publish as PDF or XPS** dialogue box, select **Options** button.
3.	In the **Options** dialogue box, **check** all boxes under **Include non-printing information**.
4.	Press **OK**.
5.	select **Publish**.
