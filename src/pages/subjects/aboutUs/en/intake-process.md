# Introduction

## Why an intake process

We created this process to make things clearer and easier for everyone. Over time, we noticed that without a defined approach, it was hard to stay consistent and make sure we were meeting accessibility standards. This process gives us a simple roadmap to follow so that:

* Everyone knows what steps to take and when.
* We stay aligned with accessibility requirements and best practices.
* We reduce confusion and save time by having a clear structure.
* We keep improving as we learn and adapt.

Our goal is to make digital accessible for all, and this process is an important part of getting there.

## Definition of the 8 phases 

### Phase 0 Request submission 

This first phase is about officially sending in a project or task request. It includes basic steps like making sure the idea or task is explained clearly, figuring out who needs to be involved, collecting the needed information, and finally, submitting the request for the new project or task. 

#### Deliverable 

Completed project proposal or official request form. 

#### Roles 

* Requester (Responsible) 
* Project Management WG (Accountable) 

### Phase 1 Triage 

In this phase, the team reviews each request to see if it is possible to do, how important it is, and if it fits with the main goals. They look at what is needed, talk to the right people, and decide if the request is doable and how urgent it is. 

#### Deliverable 

* A priority will be assigned to the request. Depending on where the request came in, either a priority will be assigned using the [a11y_benchmark_matrix.xlsx](https://052gc-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/julie_belisleboutet_csps-efpc_gc_ca/Documents/a11y_benchmark_matrix.xlsx?d=wb333c773943748e1b3fa37836c5b4c15&csf=1&web=1&e=rs7bcR) or looking at the result case the user submits a request via the [MSform](https://forms.office.com/r/LCSKQZpf4d). * (the MsForm, is automatically applying the matrix.) 

\* \*We aim to provide multiple methods for submitting requests or making contact.*   

#### Roles 

* Project Management WG (Responsible), 
* Executive Owner (Accountable), 
* Subject Matter Experts (Consulted). 

### Phase 2 Decision 

Once the request has been reviewed, a final decision is made about what happens next. This includes finishing the project plan, getting any needed approvals, making sure there are enough people and resources, and setting a timeline so the project or task can start smoothly. 

#### Deliverable 

Approval document, if applicable 

#### Roles 

* Executive Owner (Accountable), 
* Project Management WG (Responsible), 
* Development WG (Consulted). 

### Phase 3 GitHub Discussion (when applicable) 

This phase involves collaborative planning and discussion, often using platforms like GitHub to track progress and facilitate communication, where activities might include creating issues, assigning tasks, and discussing implementation strategies, as well as collaborating on project planning and task assignment. 

#### Deliverable 

Documented discussions and action items. 

#### Roles 

* Project Management WG (Responsible), 
* Development WG (Consulted), 
* UX, Design, Research WG (Consulted), 

### Phase 4 Action 

The action phase is when the real work on the project or task starts. During this time, the team follows the plan, creates the needed materials or products, and has regular meetings to make sure everything is going well and everyone is on track. 

#### Deliverable 

Project outputs such as prototypes and draft content. 

#### Roles 

* Development WG (Responsible), 
* Content WG (Consulted), 
* UX, Design, Research WG (Consulted), 

### Phase 5 Quality Assurance & Review 

Quality checks and reviews are important to make sure the project is done right. This includes testing, checking, and fixing what the team has made so that everything meets the needed standards and expectations. Additionally, this phase often involves translation and linguistic review to ensure clarity, accuracy, and accessibility for all intended audiences. 

#### Deliverable 

Test results and revised project outputs. 

#### Roles 

* QA Team (Responsible), 
* Development WG (Consulted), 
* Subject Matter Experts (Consulted)

### Phase 6 Approval (if applicable) 

Before the project can be published, it has to get official approval. In this step, the finished work is shown to the executive owners. They give feedback, and any needed changes are made. Once they agree everything is ready, the project can move on to the next stage. 

#### Deliverable 

Final approval document. 

#### Roles 

* Executive Owner (Accountable), 
* Project Management WG (Responsible), 
* Analytic WG (Informed). 

### Phase 7 Publishing 

The publishing phase makes the project available to the intended audience by finalizing the content, setting up distribution channels, and releasing the product; during this stage. The main job in this stage is to make sure the project reaches its audience. 

#### Deliverable 

Published materials. 

#### Roles 

* Content WG (Responsible), 
* Communications Team (Consulted), 
* Executive Owner (Accountable). 

### Phase 8 Post-production and Communication 

After the project is published, the team works on getting more people to know about it. This includes telling others about the project, asking users for their opinions, and making changes if needed. The main tasks are spreading the word, collecting feedback, and improving the project when necessary. 

#### Deliverable 

Marketing materials and user feedback reports. 

#### Roles 

* Communications Team (Responsible), 
* Analytic WG (Consulted), 
* UX, Design, Research WG (Informed).
