			<p>Proper planning of meetings and events is essential for the inclusion of all. There are several things to consider in the to-do list before and during these.</p>
			
<h2>Planning the meeting/event</h2>
<p>
	Every meeting/event is different and each participant has different needs.
	These guidelines will be helpful for organizing meetings and small events.
</p>
<p>
	For larger events, like conferences and summits, there will be additional
	considerations. The guide,
	<a href="https://intranet.canada.ca/hr-rh/ve/dee-deme/piae-peia-eng.asp"
		>Planning Inclusive and Accessible Events &ndash; A Handbook for Federal
		Public Servants (ODI) <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i
		><span class="wb-inv"> Internal link</span></a
	>
	should be referred to when planning large events.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The most important part of organizing an accessible meeting/event is
		maintaining open, clear and respectful communication between all
		parties.
	</li>
	<li>
		Service providers are highly-trained and skilled professionals. Many of
		them have long histories of working with ESDC and its stakeholders, it
		is important to maintain a positive working relationship.
	</li>
	<li>
		Accessibility services do not necessarily require a statement of work,
		if they are generic services and not specialised. It is possible to
		accept a quote and pay using a corporate credit card.
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			See here for more information for
			<a href="https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/Statement_of_Work_(SOW)"
				>Statement of Work (SOW).<i
					class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"
				></i
				><span class="wb-inv"> Internal link</span></a
			>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Always ensure beforehand that the service provider accepts credit
			cards.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		If undertaking a
		<a
			href="https://iservice.prv/eng/finance/purchasing/probity_questions.shtml"
			>sole-source contract <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i
			><span class="wb-inv"> Internal link</span></a
		>
		(under $40K) for accessibility services, it is required to prove that
		there are no alternative sources of supply for the same or equivalent
		support.
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			See here for the
			<a
				href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/supply-manual/annex/3/1"
				>Treasury Board questions for sole source.</a

		</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Prior to meeting or event</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Accessible by Design from the start: meeting/event planners are
		encouraged to consider accessibility from the start, and not implement
		it after the fact.
	</li>
	<li>
		In the meeting invite always indicate that employees who require
		accommodations, such as: Sign Language Interpreters (SLI), Communication
		Access Realtime Translation (CART is a Real-time speech-to-text
		translation of all spoken words and environmental sounds), large fonts,
		etc., should contact the organizer as soon as possible in order to
		ensure availability of services.
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Accommodation requests sent to the organizer should have a deadline
			to ensure the accommodations can be secured with enough notice, and
			that service providers will be available.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If participants do require accommodations, follow-up to confirm if
			they will be providing their own or if they would like you to
			arrange services. Ask if they have a preferred service provider.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		Provide multiple methods to join the meeting such as dial-in, web, and
		mobile devices.
	</li>
	<li>
		Schedule health breaks for longer meetings and ensure they occur on
		time.
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			These are helpful for participants that may need to take medication,
			have a break for their service dog, self-care, and more.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		Participants may not feel comfortable sharing their disabilities with
		organizers, and not want their information to be shared or used
		elsewhere. To ensure participants feel comfortable to request the
		accommodations they need, provide them with a link to the privacy policy
		<a
			href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/transparency/consultation-privacy-policy.html"
			>ESDC Consultation and engagement activities privacy notice
			statement.</a
		>
	</li>
	<li>
		For an open-door type meeting where you have no way of knowing the needs
		of your participants, then you should provide as many accommodations as
		possible, including but not limited to simultaneous English/French
		translation, CART (Communication Access Realtime Translation), sign
		language interpreters in both American Sign Language (ASL &ndash;
		English) and Langue des signes qu&eacute;b&eacute;coise (LSQ &ndash;
		French). You will need to secure official language interpretation
		(English &ndash; French) if you expect to have both languages spoken
		during the event.
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Please see
			<a
				href="./CART-services-Sign-Language-Interpreters
            "
				>CART services and Sign Language Interpreters (SLI)</a
			>
			for additional information regarding CART services and SLI.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Note that adding multiple accommodation features may increase
			technical complexity (e.g. need for multiple channels for
			simultaneous interpretation), if special accommodations are required
			please contact us by
			<a href="https://a11yrmt.ca/openrequest-en.php"
				>opening a request.</a
			>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		Ensure all meeting-related emails, documents, and presentations are
		accessible and sent to participants and to all service providers at
		least one week prior to the meeting.
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Consult
			<a
				href="https://bati-itao.github.io/resources/accessible-documents-en.html"
				>Accessible Documents - ESDC / IT Accessibility Office</a
			>
			for additional information on creating accessible documents.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		For bilingual meetings send the unilingual documents/presentations (one
		in English and one in French) one week prior to participants and to all
		service providers. The presentations should also include the translated
		speaker notes as well as the alternative text.
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Please see
			<a href="./Official-languages-recommendations"
				>Official Languages (OL) recommendations</a
			>
			for additional information regarding Official Languages
			recommendations.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		For meetings/events that include accommodations and/or service providers
		do a &ldquo;Dry Run&rdquo;, practice meeting a couple of days before the
		event to make sure everyone can connect, and everything runs smoothly.
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			On the day of the event, about one hour before the start time, ask
			all interpreters and captionists to join the event to ensure no
			technical issues with login and to ensure everything is working.
		</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Best practices for presenters</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Consult the
		<a
			href="https://intranet.canada.ca/hr-rh/ve/dee-deme/piae-peia-eng.asp#s12_10"
			>Briefing the Event team, Facilitators and Presenters
			<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i

		section of the
		<a href="https://intranet.canada.ca/hr-rh/ve/dee-deme/piae-peia-eng.asp"
			>Planning Inclusive and Accessible Events - A Handbook for Federal
			Public Servants. <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i
			><span class="wb-inv">Internal link</span></a
		>
	</li>
	<li>Announce your name before speaking.</li>
	<li>Use plain language and explain all terms and acronyms.</li>
	<li>Speak at a moderate pace and enunciate clearly.</li>
	<li>Find a quiet environment to avoid noise distractions.</li>
	<li>Use a plain and non-distracting background.</li>
	<li>
		Use adequate lighting when sharing video for individuals who lip-read.
	</li>
	<li>Face your camera when talking for individuals who lip-read.</li>
	<li>
		Respect your allotted time, to ensure health breaks and the meeting ends
		as scheduled.
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conducting the meeting</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Use the spotlight feature to spotlight presenters&rsquo; and
		interpreters&rsquo; videos as required, so that all participants will
		have a focus on their videos.
	</li>
	<li>
		Introduce interpreters and/or captioners at the start of the meeting.
	</li>
	<li>
		Remind participants how to &ldquo;pin&rdquo; interpreters and speakers
		if needed.
	</li>
	<li>
		Include the link to the captioning service in the chat at the beginning
		of the meeting, and again about ten minutes later. The captioning
		service link can also be sent by email to participants, and included in
		the invitation.
	</li>
	<li>
		When possible and with the consent of all participants, set the meeting
		to be recorded in order to allow participants to review the presentation
		and take notes at their own pace.
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Notify the participants on how and when the recording will be shared
			with them.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		For large meetings/events ensure participants are muted with their
		cameras off, for non-speakers, upon entry and inform them of this.
	</li>
	<li>
		Describe all visual material (such as PowerPoints and screen shares).
	</li>
	<li>
		If using MS Teams, encourage presenters to use the Share PowerPoint
		feature instead of just sharing their screen to allow assistive
		technology users to engage with the PowerPoint.
	</li>
	<li>
		Mention to participants to use the chat only for questions, as it can
		become overwhelming and distracting for some to have too many chat
		messages.
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Read relevant chat messages aloud.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		Mention to participants to use the Raise your hand feature to ask
		questions. Participants may motion on camera or post in the chat if they
		are unable to use the Raise hand feature.
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Ensure to have a meeting organizer/presenter monitor the video feeds
			if someone is gesturing on camera.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		Foster an inclusive and safe space by encouraging disability-safe
		language during meetings by raising awareness of ableist language and
		preferred terminology.
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Avoid phrases such as, “turning a blind eye to…”, and “being deaf
			to…”.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Encourage phrases such as “person with a disability” and not
			“handicapped”, or “wheelchair-bound”, etc.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		Discourage cross-talk among participants. Only one person should be
		speaking at a time, allowing for clear communication.
	</li>
	<li>
		Encourage participants if they would like a turn to speak, to use the
		Raise hand feature, or motion on camera or post in the chat, if they are
		unable to use that feature.
	</li>
	<li>Remind participants of in-event etiquette:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Stay on mute when not speaking.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Encourage participants to use plain language.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Keep camera off, if not speaking, to reduce visual stimuli.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Turn your camera on when speaking, to allow others who lip-read to
			do so
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Some participants may have anxiety or other accommodation needs
				that would require them not be on camera. If participants are
				unable to be on camera, ensure that their message is still
				clearly communicated to all other participants.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>
		Send relevant materials and links that were shared in the chat by email
		after the meeting.
	</li>
	<li>
		Strive to end the meeting on time to respect participants&rsquo;
		schedules and time.
	</li>
</ul>
