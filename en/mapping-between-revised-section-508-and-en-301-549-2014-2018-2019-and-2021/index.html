      <h2 id="intended-audience" tabindex="-1">Intended Audience</h2>
      <p>The intended audience is Technical and Contracting Authorities within SSC and the Government of Canada (<abbr>GC</abbr>), as well as Suppliers who are delivering Information and Communications Technology (<abbr>ICT</abbr>) products and services.</p>
      <h2 id="background" tabindex="-1">Background</h2>
      <p>This document deals with technical standards for ICT accessibility. The most common standards are the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<abbr>WCAG</abbr>), Revised Section 508 and EN 301 549 Harmonised European Standard for ICT Accessibility.</p>
      <p>The Revised Section 508 (2017) provides the technical standard for the US government to procure accessible products and services. This standard is, by design, closely harmonised with the EN 301 549 (2014) – which drew its requirements largely from the original Section 508 standards and WCAG 2.0. Consequently, these standards are very similar but do contain key differences. The EN 301 549 has been updated four times since the release of the Revised Section 508, introducing further differences between the standards.</p>
      <h2 id="purpose" tabindex="-1">Purpose</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this document is to identify the similarities and differences between Revised Section 508 and the EN 301 549 standards.</p>
      <p>As the EN 301 549 standards continue to evolve and release updates, this document shows the progression of the EN 301 549 standards from 2014 through the proceeding updates of 2018, 2019 and 2021. This information is important as the GC is moving towards adopting the EN 301 549 (2021) as its accessibility standard for ICT. The GC, as part of the solicitation process, may ask suppliers to provide accessibility conformance reports based on the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (<abbr>VPAT</abbr>). Each VPAT is based on a specific technical standard – Revised Section 508, EN 301 549, or WCAG. Suppliers, technical authorities and contracting authorities need to understand the differences between these standards to ensure that the accessibility requirements are properly addressed.</p>
      <h2 id="summary-of-differences" tabindex="-1">Summary of differences</h2>
      <h3 id="wcag-to-revised-section-508-en-301-549" tabindex="-1">WCAG to Revised Section 508 / EN 301 549</h3>
      <p>WCAG, while technology-agnostic, is typically applicable to websites and web applications. For these products, specifying WCAG 2.0 level AA or 2.1 level AA as a technical standard may be sufficient. However, the other standards include additional requirements which may apply to web applications that provide any of the following features: documented accessibility features, authoring tools, two-way communication, video and conversion of information between electronic formats. The other standards also include requirements for support and documentation, which may apply to website or web application procurements.</p>
      <p>Through the WCAG2ICT Task Force, the requirements of WCAG have been adapted to more precisely address the requirements for other kinds of ICT including non-web software and non-web documents. These adaptations have been integrated into Revised Section 508 and EN 301 549, so specifying those standards will result in clearer accessibility requirements for non-web ICT products than specifying WCAG would.</p>
      <p>While Revised Section 508 and EN 301 549 include WCAG leveled requirements, these standards have a broader scope. For hardware ICT and ICT services, WCAG will not properly address accessibility requirements. If the functionality of the product or service may not be fully addressed by WCAG, GC procurements should specify the EN 301 549 standard.</p>
      <h3 id="revised-section-508-to-en-301-549-2014" tabindex="-1">Revised Section 508 to EN 301 549 (2014)</h3>
      <p>These standards are closely harmonised. Some requirements vary in specificity, with the EN 301 549 usually taking a more general approach. Revised Section 508 requirements may refer to specific US standards, while the EN 301 549 either includes the relevant specifications within the document or refers to international standards. Some general requirements of Revised Section 508 are only addressed in the Software chapter of the EN 301 549, so the Software requirements may need to be included even for hardware devices which have displays.</p>
      <h3 id="en-301-549-2014-to-en-301-549-2018" tabindex="-1">EN 301 549 (2014) to EN 301 549 (2018)</h3>
      <p>Primarily, WCAG-related chapters (9, 10 and 11) differ between these versions, along with several explanatory updates, stylistic rewordings, numbering changes, and functional changes. The 2014 version includes all WCAG 2.0 level A and AA success criteria, while the 2018 version is updated to directly reference all WCAG 2.1 level A and AA success criteria. (Although the 2018 and 2019 versions do not duplicate WCAG text, we have included the new requirements with the text in this document for clarity.) The numbering in WCAG-related chapters in the 2018 version directly follows WCAG 2.1 success criteria. For example, clause 9.2.3.1 of the EN 301 549 refers to WCAG success criterion 2.3.1.</p>
      <h3 id="en-301-549-2018-to-en-301-549-2019" tabindex="-1">EN 301 549 (2018) to EN 301 549 (2019)</h3>
      <p>The majority of changes are stylistic rewordings and additional explanatory notes. There are 14 new requirements, primarily relating to use with limited hearing. A few requirements from the 2018 version have been split up or consolidated. Requirements relating to physical access to ICT have been reworked into “8.3 Stationary ICT”. Numbering is otherwise consistent between versions.</p>

      <p>The EN 301 549 V3.2.1 (2021) document was developed from EN 301 549 V2.1.2 (2018). There are no new requirements. The Annex F track changes table, has been added for future releases. Some clarification in 7.1.1 concerning captioning but numbering is otherwise consistent between versions. The numbering in WCAG-related chapters 9, 10 and 11 in the 2021 version directly follows WCAG 2.1 success criteria. For example, clause 9.2.3.1 of the EN 301 549 (2021) refers to WCAG success criterion 2.3.1. As stated in the footnotes, there are items that point to clauses that are not included in this document. They are only included if it is a new requirement and it points only to the WCAG guidelines.</p>

                <p>NOTE 1: Locking or toggle controls are those controls that can only have two or three states and that keep their state while being used.</p>
                <p>NOTE 2: An example of a locking or toggle control is the "Caps Lock" key found on most keyboards. Another example is the volume button on a pay telephone, which can be set at normal, loud, or extra loud volume.</p>

                <p>The scope includes stationary ICT, of which floors and circulation spaces are "an integral part" (typically kiosks and cabins), and where there are external reach ranges relevant for operating the stationary ICT.</p>
                <p>Clauses 8.3.2 to 8.3.4 specify mandatory limits for the maximum and minimum height of operable parts and displays. Based on dimensions shown in <strong>F</strong>igure 53 of ISO 21542:2011, it is recommended that the possible height range is reduced to:</p>
