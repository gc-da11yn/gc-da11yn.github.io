          <p>ICT accessibility ensures that people with and without disabilities can access the same information, perform the same tasks, and receive the same services using information technology. It is the digital equivalent to accessibility in the physical environment —the curb cuts, ramps, railings, etc., of the digital age. While <abbr title="Information and Communications Technology">ICT</abbr> accessibility can provide usability benefits to everyone who uses ICT, it is a vital necessity to many people with disabilities.</p>

      <p>At first glance, some requirements may appear to be unrelated to this product or service. They have been included for consideration since the full feature set of a Vendor’s product or service may not be known. For example, a video may be embedded into product documentation, so accessibility requirements for video and audio may become relevant.</p>

      <p>The information in this document uses the language from Clauses 5-13 and Annex C Determination of conformance from the EN 301 549 v3.2.1 (2021-03) Harmonised European Standard – Accessibility requirements for <abbr title="Information and Communications Technology">ICT</abbr> products and services (the “Standard”). While the Standard has inconsistencies of how the Clause and Determination of conformance names are presented, due to technical reasons, the wording used for the Determination of conformance in this document, is the wording used for the Clause names in Clauses 5-13.</p>

      <p><strong>4.2.1. Usage without vision:</strong> Where ICT provides visual modes of operation, the ICT provides at least one mode of operation that does not require vision. This is essential for users without vision and benefits many more users in different situations.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>NOTE 1: A web page or application with a well formed semantic structure can allow users without vision to identify, navigate and interact with a visual user interface.</li>
        <li>NOTE 2: Audio and tactile user interfaces may contribute towards meeting this clause.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>4.2.2. Usage with limited vision:</strong> Where ICT provides visual modes of operation, the ICT provides features that enable users to make better use of their limited vision. This is essential for users with limited vision and benefits many more users in different situations.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>NOTE 1: Magnification, reduction of required field of vision and control of contrast, brightness and intensity can contribute towards meeting this clause.</li>
        <li>NOTE 2: Where significant features of the user interface are dependent on depth perception, the provision of additional methods of distinguishing between the features may contribute towards meeting this clause.</li>
        <li>NOTE 3: Users with limited vision may also benefit from non-visual access (see clause 4.2.1).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>4.2.3. Usage without perception of colour:</strong> Where ICT provides visual modes of operation, the ICT provides a visual mode of operation that does not require user perception of colour. This is essential for users with limited colour perception and benefits many more users in different situations.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>NOTE: Where significant features of the user interface are colour-coded, the provision of additional methods of distinguishing between the features may contribute towards meeting this clause.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>4.2.4. Usage without hearing:</strong> Where ICT provides auditory modes of operation, the ICT provides at least one mode of operation that does not require hearing. This is essential for users without hearing and benefits many more users in different situations.</p>
      <ul>

              <p>Where ICT provides a means for two-way voice communication and for users to communicate by RTT, it shall allow concurrent voice and text through a single user connection.</p>
              <p>NOTE 1: With many-party communication, as in a conference system, it is allowed (but not required or necessarily recommended) that RTT be handled in a single display field and that "turn-taking" be necessary to avoid confusion (in the same way that turn-taking is required for those presenting/talking with voice).</p>
              <p>NOTE 2: With many-party communication, best practice is for hand-raising for voice users and RTT users to be handled in the same way, so that voice and RTT users are in the same queue.</p>
              <p>NOTE 3: With a many-party conference system that has chat as one of its features - the RTT (like the voice) would typically be separate from the chat so that RTT use does not interfere with chat (i.e. people can be messaging in the chat field while the person is presenting/talking with RTT - in the same manner that people message using the chat feature while people are talking with voice). RTT users would then use RTT for presenting and use the Chat feature to message while others are presenting (via Voice or RTT).</p>
              <p>NOTE 4: The availability of voice and RTT running concurrently (and separately from chat) can also allow the RTT field to support text captioning when someone is speaking (and it is therefore not being used for RTT since it is not the RTT user's turn to speak).</p>
              <p>NOTE 5: Where both server-side software and local hardware and software are required to provide voice communication, where neither part can support voice communication without the other and are sold as a unit for the voice communication function, the local and server-side components are considered a single product.</p>

For ICT interoperating with other ICT using the IP Multimedia Sub-System (IMS) to implement VOIP, the set of protocols specified in ETSI TS 126 114 [i.10], ETSI TS 122 173 [i.11] and ETSI TS 134 229 [i.12] describe how IETF RFC 4103 [i.13] would apply;</p>
              <p>c) ICT interoperating with other ICT using technologies other than a or b, above, using a relevant and applicable common specification for RTT exchange that is published and available for the environments in which they will be operating. This common specification shall include a method for indicating loss or corruption of characters;</p>
              <p>d) ICT interoperating with other ICT using a standard for RTT that has been introduced for use in any of the above environments, and is supported by all of the other active ICT that support voice and RTT in that environment.</p>
              <p>NOTE 1: In practice, new standards are introduced as an alternative codec/protocol that is supported alongside the existing common standard and used when all end-to-end components support it while technology development, combined with other reasons including societal development and cost efficiency, may make others become obsolete.</p>
              <p>NOTE 2: Where multiple technologies are used to provide voice communication, multiple interoperability mechanisms may be needed to ensure that all users are able to use RTT.</p>
              <p>EXAMPLE: A conferencing system that supports voice communication through an internet connection might provide RTT over an internet connection using a proprietary RTT method (option c). However, regardless of whether the RTT method is proprietary or non-proprietary, if the conferencing system also offers telephony communication it will also need to support options a or b to ensure that RTT is supported over the telephony connection.</p>

In this case, the smallest reliably composed unit of text entry available to the ICT would be the word (or phrase).</p>
              <p>NOTE 2: The 500 ms limit allows buffering of characters for this period before transmission so character by character transmission is not required unless the characters are generated more slowly than 1 per 500 ms.</p>
              <p>NOTE 3: A delay of 300 ms, or less, produces a better impression of flow to the user.</p>

              <p>Clause 6.5 (Video communications) provides performance requirements that support users who communicate using sign language and lip-reading. For these users, good usability is achieved with a resolution of at least Quarter Video Graphics Array (QVGA, 320 x 240), a frame rate of 20 frames per second and over, with a time difference between speech audio and video that does not exceed 100 ms.</p>
              <p>Increasing the resolution and frame rate further improves both sign language (especially finger spelling) and lipreading, with frame rate being more important than resolution.</p>
              <p>Time differences between audio and video (asynchronicity) can have a great impact onlip-reading - with video that lags behind audio having greater negative effect.</p>
              <p>End-to-end latency can be a problem in video (sign) communication. Overall delay values below 400 ms are preferred, with an increase in preference down to 100 ms. Overall delay depends on multiple factors, including e.g. network delay and video processing. For this reason a testable requirement on minimum values for overall delay cannot be produced.</p>
              <p>NOTE: Recommendation ITU-T F.703 [i.37] defines and gives requirements for Total Conversation that relate to the integration of audio, RTT and video in a single user connection.</p>

              <p>Requirements in clause 9 apply to web pages (as defined in clause 3.1) including:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Conformance with W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) Level AA is equivalent to conforming with clauses 9.1.1, 9.1.2, 9.1.3.1 to 9.1.3.3, 9.1.4.1 to 9.1.4.5, 9.2.1.1, 9.2.1.2, 9.2.2, 9.2.3, 9.2.4, 9.3, 9.4.1.1, 9.4.1.2 and the conformance requirements of clause 9.6 of the present document.</li>
                <li>Conformance with W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) [5] Level AA is equivalent to conforming with all of clauses 9.1 to 9.4 and the conformance requirements of clause 9.6 of the present document.</li>
                <li>Requirements for non-web documents and non-web software are given in clauses 10 and 11 respectively.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>NOTE 1: When evaluating web sites they are evaluated as individual web pages. Web applications, including mobile web applications, are covered under the definition of web page which is quite broad and covers all web content types.</p>
              <p>NOTE 2: WCAG 2.0 is identical to ISO/IEC 40500:2012: "Information technology - W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0" [4].</p>
              <p>The requirements in clauses 9.1 to 9.4 are written using the concept of satisfying success criteria (defined in clause 3.1). A web page satisfies a WCAG success criterion when the success criterion does not evaluate to false when applied to the web page. This implies that if the success criterion puts conditions on a specific feature and that specific feature does not occur in the web page, then the web page satisfies the success criterion.</p>
              <p>NOTE 3: For example, a web page that does not contain pre-recorded audio content in synchronized media will automatically satisfy WCAG success criterion 1.2.2 (captions - pre-recorded) and, in consequence, will also conform to clause 9.1.2.2.</p>
              <p>In addition to Level AA success criteria, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines also include success criteria for Level AAA. These are listed in clause 9.5 of the present document. Web authors and procurement accessibility specialists are encouraged to consider whether any of the WCAG Level AAA success criteria offer suggestions that may be applicable and relevant to their project, as well as potentially beneficial to some users.</p>
              <p>NOTE 4: The W3C states that "It is not recommended that Level AAA conformance be required as a general policy for entire sites because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA Success Criteria for some content".</p>
              <p>NOTE 5: "Void" clauses have been inserted in order to maintain alignment with the numbering of WCAG 2.1 Level A and Level AA Success Criteria.</p>

              <p>NOTE 2: A single document may be composed of multiple files such as the video content and closed caption text. This fact is not usually apparent to the end-user consuming the document/content.</p>
              <p>NOTE 3: Documents require a user agent in order for the content to be presented to users. The requirements for user agents can be found in clause 11.</p>
              <p>NOTE 4: The requirements for content that is part of software, can be found in clause 11.</p>
              <p>NOTE 5: The success criteria set out in clause 10 are intended to harmonize with the Working Group Note [i.26] produced by the W3C's <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG2ICT-TF/">WCAG2ICT Task Force</a>.</p>
              <p>NOTE 6: "Void" clauses have been inserted in order to maintain alignment of the numbering in clauses 9, 10 and 11.</p>

              <p>NOTE 2: This success criterion is about the ability to allow users to enlarge the text on screen at least up to 200 % without needing to use assistive technologies. This means that the application provides some means for enlarging the text 200 % (zoom or otherwise) without loss of content or functionality or that the application works with the platform features that meet this requirement.</p>
              <p>NOTE 3: It is best practice to use only fonts that allow for scaling without loss of quality (e.g. pixelized presentation). This applies in particular to embedded fonts.</p>

                <li><strong>Moving, blinking, scrolling:</strong> For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity where it is essential; and</li>
                <li><strong>Auto-updating:</strong> For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is part of an activity where it is essential.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>NOTE 1: For requirements related to flickering or flashing content, refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#seizures-and-physical-reactions">WCAG 2.1 Guideline 2.3</a>.</p>

              <p>NOTE 3: Content that is updated periodically by software or that is streamed to the user agent is not required to preserve or present information that is generated or received between the initiation of the pause and resuming presentation, as this may not be technically possible, and in many situations could be misleading to do so.</p>
              <p>NOTE 4: An animation that occurs as part of a preload phase or similar situation can be considered essential if interaction cannot occur during that phase for all users and if not indicating progress could confuse users or cause them to think that content was frozen or broken.</p>

If the user uses a mechanism other than putting focus on that portion of the compound document with which they mean to interact (e.g. by a menu choice or special keyboard gesture), any resulting change of context would not be subject to this success criterion because it was not caused by a change of focus.</p>

              <p>NOTE 1: Start and end tags that are missing a critical character in their formation, such as a closing angle bracket or a mismatched attribute value quotation mark are not complete.</p>
              <p>NOTE 2: Markup is not always available to assistive technology or to user selectable user agents such as browsers. In such cases, conformance to this [requirement] would have no impact on accessibility as it can for web content where it is exposed.</p>
              <p>NOTE 3: Examples of markup that is separately exposed and available to assistive technologies and to user agents include but are not limited to: documents encoded in HTML, ODF, and OOXML. In these examples, the markup can be parsed entirely in two ways: (a) by assistive technologies which may directly open the document, (b) by assistive technologies using DOM APIs of user agents for these document formats.</p>

              </ul>
              <p>NOTE 1: User agents are examples of software that provide a user interface. They retrieve, render and facilitate end user interaction with authored content. User agents play a necessary role in the accessibility of authored content rendered in the user interface. UAAG 2.0 [i33] provides additional advice for those who are creating user agents and want to increase functionality when rendering authored content in an accessible way.</p>
              <p>NOTE 2: The requirements for Web content, including software that is Web content, can be found in clause 9.</p>
              <p>NOTE 3: The requirements for documents, that may be presented by user agents, can be found in clause 10.</p>
              <p>NOTE 4: Although the accessibility of command line interfaces is not dealt with in the present document, accessibility may be achieved by context specific requirements, some of which may be found in clauses 5 or 11.</p>
              <p>Requirements in clauses 11.1 to 11.5 apply to software:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>that is not a web page;</li>
                <li>not embedded in web pages nor used in the rendering or functioning of the page.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Clause 9 provides requirements for software that is in web pages or that is embedded in web pages and that is used in the rendering or that is intended to be rendered together with the web page in which it is embedded.</p>
              <p>Some requirements in clauses 11.1 to 11.5 have different versions for open or closed functionality. In those cases, the corresponding clause will be divided into two subclauses.</p>
              <p>The success criteria set out in clauses 11.1 to 11.5 are intended to harmonize with the W3C Working Group Note [i.26] produced by the W3C's <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG2ICT-TF/">WCAG2ICT Task Force</a>.</p>
              <p>NOTE 5: Software that provides a user interface includes its own content. Some examples of content in software include: the controls and text displayed in a menu bar of a graphical user interface application, images that appear in a toolbar, prompts spoken in an auditory user interface, other user interaction controls, and other text, graphics or material that is not loaded from outside the software.</p>
              <p>NOTE 6: "Void" clauses have been inserted in order to maintain alignment of the numbering in clauses 9, 10 and 11.</p>

              <p>NOTE: The WCAG 2.1 definition of "captions" notes that "in some countries, captions are called subtitles". They are also sometimes referred to as "subtitles for the hearing impaired". Per the definition in WCAG 2.1, to meet this success criterion, whether called captions or subtitles, they would have to provide "synchronized visual and / or text alternative for both speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the media content" where non-speech information includes "sound effects, music, laughter, speaker identification and location".</p>

              <p>NOTE 2: This success criteria is applicable to all content in the software (whether or not there is an alternate accessible mode of operation of the software) since any part of a software that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole software (including a user interface element that enables the user to activate the alternate accessible mode of operation).</p>
              <p>NOTE 3: Content that is updated periodically by software or that is streamed to the user agent is not required to preserve or present information that is generated or received between the initiation of the pause and resuming presentation, as this may not be technically possible, and in many situations could be misleading to do so.</p>

If the user uses a mechanism other than putting focus on that portion of the compound document with which they mean to interact (e.g. by a menu choice or special keyboard gesture), any resulting change of context would not be subject to this success criterion because it was not caused by a change of focus.</p>

              <p>NOTE 1: Start and end tags that are missing a critical character in their formation, such as a closing angle bracket or a mismatched attribute value quotation mark are not complete.</p>
              <p>NOTE 2: Markup is not always available to assistive technology or to user selectable user agents such as browsers. In such cases, conformance to this [requirement] would have no impact on accessibility as it can for web content where it is exposed.</p>
              <p>NOTE 3: Examples of markup that is separately exposed and available to assistive technologies and to user agents include but are not limited to: documents encoded in HTML, ODF, and OOXML. In these examples, the markup can be parsed entirely in two ways: (a) by assistive technologies which may directly open the document, (b) by assistive technologies using DOM APIs of user agents for these document formats.</p>
              <p>NOTE 4: Examples of markup used internally for persistence of the software user interface that are never exposed to assistive technology include but are not limited to: XUL, and FXML. In these examples assistive technology only interacts with the user interface of generated software.</p>

              <p>NOTE 1: This success criterion is primarily for software developers who develop or use custom user interface components. Standard user interface components on most accessibility-supported platforms already meet this success criterion when used according to specification.</p>
              <p>NOTE 2: For conforming to this success criterion, it is usually best practice for software user interfaces to use the accessibility services provided by platform software. These accessibility services enable interoperability between software user interfaces and both assistive technologies and accessibility features of software in standardised ways. Most platform accessibility services go beyond programmatic exposure of name and role, and programmatic setting of states, properties and values (and notification of same), and specify additional information that could or should be exposed and / or set (for instance, a list of the available actions for a given user interface component, and a means to programmatically execute one of the listed actions).</p>

              <p>Platform software shall provide a set of documented platform accessibility services that enable assistive technology to interoperate with software that provides a user interface running on the platform software.</p>
              <p>Where a user interface concept corresponding to one of the clauses 11.5.2.5 to 11.5.2.17 is supported within the software environment, the platform software should support that requirement. For example, selection attributes from clause 11.5.2.14 (Modification of focus and selection attributes) may not exist in environments that do not allow selection, which is most commonly associated with copy and paste.</p>
              <p>NOTE 1: These define the minimum functionality available to assistive technologies when using platform services.</p>
              <p>NOTE 2: The definition of platform in clause 3.1 applies to software that provides services to other software, including but not limited to, operating systems, web browsers, virtual machines.</p>
              <p>NOTE 3: In some platforms these services may be called accessibility services, but in some other platforms these services may be provided as part of the user interface services.</p>
              <p>NOTE 4: Typically these services belong to the same set of services that are described in clause 11.5.2.1.</p>
              <p>NOTE 5: To comply with this requirement the platform software can provide its own set of services or expose the services provided by its underlying platform layers, if those services conform to this requirement.</p>

      <h2 id="annex-chapter-14-conformance" tabindex="-1">Annex – Chapter 14 Conformance</h2>
      <p>Conformance to the present document is achieved by meeting all the applicable requirements, these are clauses containing the word &quot;shall&quot;. Those clauses containing the word &quot;should&quot; are recommendations and are not required for conformance.</p>
      <p>All clauses except those in clause 12 are self-scoping. This means they are introduced with the phrase 'Where ICT &lt;pre-condition&gt;'. A requirement is met when the pre-condition is true and the corresponding test (in Annex C) is passed. When one of the pre-conditions is false the requirement is not applicable. Consequently, the result of the tests in Annex C can be: not applicable, pass, fail, or (in exceptional circumstances) not testable.</p>
      <p>ICT is often comprised of an assembly of two or more items of ICT. In some cases, two or more interoperable items of ICT may together meet more requirements of the standard when one item complements the functionality of the other and the sum together meets more of the accessibility requirements. However, combining two items of ICT, both of which fail to meet any particular requirement, will not lead to a combined ICT system that meets that requirement.</p>
      <p>The present document does not prioritize requirements.</p>
      <p>NOTE 1: Conformance with the accessibility requirements could be affected by subsequent implementation or maintenance.</p>
      <p>NOTE 2: Sampling is frequently required on complex ICT when there are too many instances of the object to be tested. The present document cannot recommend specific ICT evaluation sampling techniques as these are context specific.</p>
      <p>The inherent nature of certain situations makes it impossible to make reliable and definitive statements that accessibility requirements have been met. In those situations therefore, the requirements in the present document are not applicable:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>when the product is in a failure, repair or maintenance state where the ordinary set of input or output functions are not available;</li>
        <li>during those parts of start-up, shutdown, and other state transitions that can be completed without user interaction.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>NOTE 3: Even in the above situations, it is best practice to apply requirements in the present document wherever it is feasible and safe to do so.</p>

      <h3 id="31-terms" tabindex="-1">3.1 Terms</h3>
      <p>For the purposes of the present document, the terms given in ETSI EG 201 013 [i.4] and the following apply:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>accessibility</dt>
        <dd>extent to which products, systems, services, environments and facilities can be used by people from a population with the widest range of user needs, characteristics and capabilities, to achieve identified goals in identified contexts of use (from ISO 9241-11:2018 [i.15]) <ul>
            <li>NOTE 1: Context of use includes direct use or use supported by assistive technologies.</li>
            <li>NOTE 2: The context in which the ICT is used may affect its overall accessibility. This context could include other products and services with which the ICT may interact.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>access space</dt>
        <dd>space intended to be occupied by the person, including their Assistive Technology, while they are using the product</dd>
        <dt>Assistive Listening Devices (ALDs)</dt>
        <dd>devices that help separate the sounds, particularly speech, that a person wants to hear from background noise by bringing sound directly into the ear <ul>
            <li>NOTE: These are often found in meetings and public venues such as plays, concerts and places of worship. They can also be used at home with televisions and other products with auditory output.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>Assistive Technology (AT)</dt>
        <dd>equipment, product system, hardware, software or service that is used to increase, maintain or improve capabilities of individuals (from ISO/IEC Guide 71:2014 [i.35]) <ul>
            <li>NOTE 1: Assistive technology is an umbrella term that is broader than assistive products.</li>
            <li>NOTE 2: Assistive technology can include assistive services, and professional services needed for assessment, recommendation and provision.</li>
            <li>NOTE 3: Where ICT does not support directly connected assistive technology, but which can be operated by a system connected over a network or other remote connection, such a separate system (with any included assistive technology) can also be considered assistive technology. This is an additional note, not included in ISO/IEC Guide 71:2014 [i.35].</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>audio description</dt>
        <dd>additional audible narrative, interleaved with the dialogue, which describes the significant aspects of the visual content of audio-visual media that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone <ul>
            <li>NOTE: This is also variously described using terms such as "video description" or variants such as "descriptive narration".</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>authoring tool</dt>
        <dd>software that can be used to create or modify content <ul>
            <li>NOTE 1: An authoring tool may be used by a single user or multiple users working collaboratively.</li>
            <li>NOTE 2: An authoring tool may be a single stand-alone application or be comprised of collections of applications.</li>
            <li>NOTE 3: An authoring tool may produce content that is intended for further modification or for use by end-users.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>caption</dt>
        <dd>synchronized visual and/or text alternative for both speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the media content (after WCAG 2.1 [5]) <ul>
            <li>NOTE: This is also variously described using terms such as "subtitles" or variants such as "subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing".</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>closed functionality</dt>
        <dd>functionality that is limited by characteristics that prevent a user from attaching, installing or using assistive technology</dd>
        <dt>content</dt>
        <dd>information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of software, including code or mark-up that defines the content's structure, presentation, and interactions (after WCAG2ICT [i.26]) <ul>
            <li>NOTE: Content occurs in three places: web pages, documents and software. When content occurs in a web page or a document, a user agent is needed in order to communicate the content's information and sensory experience to the user. When content occurs in software, a separate user agent is not needed in order to communicate the content's information and sensory experience to the user - the software itself performs that function.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>context of use</dt>
        <dd>combination of users, goals and tasks, resources, and environment. (from ISO 9241-11:2018 [i.15]) <ul>
            <li>NOTE: The "environment" in a context of use includes the technical, physical, social, cultural and organizational environments.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>document</dt>
        <dd>logically distinct assembly of content (such as a file, set of files, or streamed media) that functions as a single entity rather than a collection, that is not part of software and that does not include its own user agent (after WCAG2ICT [i.26]) <ul>
            <li>NOTE 1: A document always requires a user agent to present its content to the user.</li>
            <li>NOTE 2: Letters, e-mail messages, spreadsheets, books, pictures, presentations, and movies are examples of documents.</li>
            <li>NOTE 3: Software configuration and storage files such as databases and virus definitions, as well as computer instruction files such as source code, batch/script files, and firmware, are examples of files that function as part of software and thus are not examples of documents. If and where software retrieves "information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user" from such files, it is just another part of the content that occurs in software and is covered by WCAG2ICT like any other parts of the software. Where such files contain one or more embedded documents, the embedded documents remain documents under this definition.</li>
            <li>NOTE 4: A collection of files zipped together into an archive, stored within a single virtual hard drive file, or stored in a single encrypted file system file, do not constitute a single document when so collected together. The software that archives/encrypts those files or manages the contents of the virtual hard drive does not function as a user agent for the individually collected files in that collection because that software is not providing a fully functioning presentation of that content.</li>
            <li>NOTE 5: Anything that can present its own content without involving a user agent, such as a self-playing book, is not a document but is software.</li>
            <li>NOTE 6: A single document may be composed of multiple files such as the video content and closed caption text. This fact is not usually apparent to the end-user consuming the document/content.</li>
            <li>NOTE 7: An assembly of files that represented the video, audio, captions and timing files for a movie is an example of a document.</li>
            <li>NOTE 8: A binder file used to bind together the various exhibits for a legal case would not be a document.</li>
            <li>NOTE 9: Documents may contain sub-documents.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>embedded</dt>
        <dd>directly included in the content that is downloaded to the user agent and its extension, and is intended to be used in rendering the web page <ul>
            <li>NOTE: Something that is downloaded using a mechanism on the web page but is not used in rendering the page is not "embedded" in the page.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>ICT network</dt>
        <dd>technology and resources supporting the connection and operation of interconnected ICT</dd>
        <dt>Information and Communication Technology (ICT)</dt>
        <dd>technology, equipment, or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment for which the principal function is the creation, conversion, duplication, automatic acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, reception, or broadcast of data or information <ul>
            <li>NOTE: Examples of ICT are web pages, electronic content, telecommunications products, computers and ancillary equipment, software including mobile applications, information kiosks and transaction machines, videos, IT services, and multifunction office machines which copy, scan, and fax documents.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>mechanically operable part</dt>
        <dd>operable part that has a mechanical interface to activate, deactivate, or adjust the ICT <ul>
            <li>NOTE: Examples of mechanically operable parts include scanner covers, notebook docking stations and lids as well as physical switches and latches.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>mechanism for private listening</dt>
        <dd>auditory output designed so that only the current user can receive the sound <ul>
            <li>NOTE: Personal headsets, directional speakers and audio hoods are examples of mechanisms for private listening.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>non-text content</dt>
        <dd>content that is not a sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined or where the sequence is not expressing something in human language (after WCAG 2.1 [5])</dd>
        <dt>non-web document</dt>

        <dt>open functionality</dt>
        <dd>functionality that supports access by assistive technology <ul>
            <li>NOTE: This is the opposite of closed functionality.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>operable part</dt>
        <dd>component of ICT used to activate, deactivate, or adjust the ICT <ul>
            <li>NOTE 1: Operable parts can be provided in either hardware (see mechanically operable parts, above) or software. An on-screen button is an example of an operable part provided by software.</li>
            <li>NOTE 2: Operable parts do not include parts involved only in maintenance or repair or other actions that are not expected of a typical user if the product is not malfunctioning. These actions include: clearing paper jams internal to the machine, replacing items or parts internal to the machine that may expose the end user to sharp or hot surfaces, replacing or repairing items designated by manufacturers as service or maintenance items in user documentation.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>platform software (platform)</dt>
        <dd>collection of software components that runs on an underlying software or hardware layer, and that provides a set of software services to other software components that allows those applications to be isolated from the underlying software or hardware layer (after ISO/IEC 13066-1 [i.19]) <ul>
            <li>NOTE: A particular software component might play the role of a platform in some situations and a client in others.</li>

        </dd>
        <dt>programmatically determinable</dt>
        <dd>able to be read by software from developer-supplied data in a way that other software, including assistive technologies, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities <ul>
            <li>NOTE: WCAG 2.1 uses "determined" where this definition uses "able to be read" (to avoid ambiguity with the word "determined").</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>Real-Time Text (RTT)</dt>
        <dd>form of a text conversation in point to point situations or in multipoint conferencing where the text being entered is sent in such a way that the communication is perceived by the user as being continuous <ul>
            <li>NOTE 1: Users will perceive communication as continuous if the delay between text being created by the sender and received by the recipient is less than 500 ms. However, the actual delay will be dependent on the communication network.</li>
            <li>NOTE 2: The creation of text will differ between systems where text is entered on a word-by-word basis (e.g. speech-to-text and predictive-text based systems) and systems where each character is separately generated (e.g. typing on a physical keyboard).</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>satisfies a success criterion</dt>
        <dd>success criterion does not evaluate to "false" when applied to the ICT (after WCAG 2.1 [5])</dd>
        <dt>single user connection</dt>
        <dd>connection that consists of sound, RTT or video (or a combination of two or three of those media) that is established by a single user action <ul>
            <li>NOTE: Even though the different media may travel over different channels, and more than one piece of hardware may be involved, it appears to the user like a single connection, and is treated by any intermediate technologies (e.g. network, auto-reception) as a single connection for purposes such as transfer.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>spoken captions/subtitles audio captions/subtitles</dt>
        <dd>captions/subtitles that are voiced over the audiovisual content (from ISO/IEC TS 20071-25 [i.31])</dd>

        <dd>ICT that stands on the floor, or is mounted on a wall or other immovable structure, and is not intended to be moved by its user <ul>
            <li>NOTE 1: Typically, stationary ICT rests on the ground (such as an information kiosk) or is installed in a wall (such as a machine that dispenses cash or performs other banking services).</li>
            <li>NOTE 2: A manufacturer cannot control the height of ICT that is put on a table by someone else, but they are able to control the reach dimensions of self-contained ICT that rests on the ground and can specify the heights for installation in walls.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>terminal</dt>
        <dd>combination of hardware and/or software with which the end user directly interacts and that provides the user interface <ul>
            <li>NOTE 1: The hardware may consist of more than one device working together e.g. a mobile device and a computer.</li>
            <li>NOTE 2: For some systems, the software that provides the user interface may reside on more than one device such as a telephone and a server.</li>

        <dt>turn-taking</dt>
        <dd>type of organization in conversation and discourse where participants speak one at a time in alternating turns</dd>
        <dt>user agent</dt>
        <dd>software that retrieves and presents content for users (after WCAG 2.1 [5]) <ul>
            <li>NOTE 1: Software that only displays the content contained within it is treated as software and not considered to be a user agent.</li>
            <li>NOTE 2: An example of software that is not a user agent is a calculator application that does not retrieve the calculations from outside the software to present it to a user. In this case, the calculator software is not a user agent, it is simply software with a user interface.</li>
            <li>NOTE 3: Software that only shows a preview of content such as a thumbnail or other non-fully functioning presentation is not providing user agent functionality.</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>user interface</dt>
        <dd>all components of an interactive system (software or hardware) that provide information and/or controls for the user to accomplish specific tasks with the interactive system (from ISO 9241-110 [i.16])</dd>
        <dt>user interface element</dt>
        <dd>entity of the user interface that is presented to the user by the software (after ISO 9241-171 [i.17]) <ul>
            <li>NOTE 1: This term is also known as "user interface component".</li>
            <li>NOTE 2: User-interface elements can be interactive or not.</li>
