      <p>For the purposes of this content, the term “event” includes activities such as: events, conferences, meetings, kiosks, training, presentations, and more.</p>
      <p>This guide provides a suggested timeline for planning your event, but it is not prescriptive.</p>
      <h3 id="common-issues-reported-by-people-with-disabilities" tabindex="-1">Common issues reported by people with disabilities</h3>
      <p>Before exploring this guide, we invite you to review common barriers about events that we collected from persons with disabilities. Please collaborate with us to address the following challenges.</p>
      <h4 id="audio" tabindex="-1">Audio</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Difficulty understanding / hearing participants and unreliable captions</li>
        <li>Participants are talking over each other, making conversations hard to comprehend</li>
        <li>Presenters are speaking too quickly, causing interpreters to struggle or skip parts of the speech</li>
        <li>Challenges in multilingual events when the language switches often and quickly, affecting the captioning</li>
        <li>Mic placement, camera and lighting hindering lip reading</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="visual" tabindex="-1">Visual</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Some cannot see the participants names or faces, making it difficult to know the name of the person speaking and learn to recognize their voice</li>
        <li>Presenters are sharing screens without providing explanations of what is visually going on, leading to missed information and context</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="mobility" tabindex="-1">Mobility</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Exclusion caused by inaccessible external engagement tools (like surveys and polls) and/or not given enough time to participate</li>
        <li>Some cannot hold a writing utensil, needing an alternative for activities involving writing on paper</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="cognitive" tabindex="-1">Cognitive</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Lack of clear event objectives, leading to participants’ difficulties in preparing and focusing</li>
        <li>Inconsistent stylings in presentation material and use of irrelevant images causing distractions</li>
        <li>Nausea from excessive on-screen motion or animations</li>
        <li>Difficulties focusing on the presentation materials and the speaker simultaneously</li>
        <li>Difficulties keeping track of a virtual text chat and the presentation at the same time</li>
        <li>Overloading participants with excessive information or lengthy presentations</li>
        <li>Insufficient time for processing or discussing ideas, limiting meaningful participation for individuals who need extra time to process information</li>
        <li>Presenters using complex language, speak in abbreviations or jargon that is difficult to understand</li>
        <li>Confusion regarding event logistics and not knowing how to enable accessibility features</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="canadian-legal-framework-for-accessible-events" tabindex="-1">Canadian legal framework for accessible events</h3>
      <p>In Canada, the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-0.6/"><em>Accessible Canada Act</em></a>, along with the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/h-6/page-1.html"><em>Canadian Human Rights Act</em></a> and the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32634"><em>Directive on the Duty to Accommodate</em></a>, urges us to create accessible events. This legal framework protects the rights of persons with disabilities to ensure their full participation in society.</p>
      <p>Here is a short summary of their relationship with handling events:</p>
      <h4 id="accessible-canada-act" tabindex="-1"><em>Accessible Canada Act</em></h4>
      <p>Aims for a barrier-free Canada by January 1, 2040, requiring the identification, removal and prevention of barriers in areas which include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Information and Communication Technologies (<abbr>ICT</abbr>) like virtual event platforms</li>
        <li>and communications (which include officially recognised languages of Deaf people in Canada: American Sign Language, Quebec Sign Language and Indigenous sign languages)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="human-rights-legislation" tabindex="-1"><em>Human Rights Legislation</em></h4>
      <p>Prohibits disability-based discrimination.</p>
      <h4 id="directive-on-the-duty-to-accommodate" tabindex="-1"><em>Directive on the Duty to Accommodate</em></h4>
      <p>Ensures the full participation of persons with disabilities by designing all systems, processes and facilities to be accessible from the start. When a barrier cannot be removed, the individual must be accommodated.</p>
      <h3 id="facts-to-keep-in-mind" tabindex="-1">Facts to keep in mind</h3>
      <h4 id="about-accommodations" tabindex="-1">About accommodations</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Events should be inclusive by default, rather than requiring participants to make accommodation requests</li>
        <li>In some cases, an accommodation for one participant can become a barrier for another</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="about-disabilities" tabindex="-1">About disabilities</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>A participation barrier is a limitation of technology and processes, not because of a person’s disability</li>
        <li>People with disabilities do not have to disclose their disability to anyone</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="about-careful-planning" tabindex="-1">About careful planning</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The more time you give yourself to plan an event, the better</li>
        <li>Consider if it would be more productive to replace the event with an email</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="virtual-events" tabindex="-1">Virtual events</h2>
      <h3 id="roadmap" tabindex="-1">Roadmap</h3>
      <p>First, you will be planning your event. Multiple decisions will have to be made, notably:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is the event bilingual?</li>
        <li>Which virtual platform will be used?</li>
        <li>Who will do what roles?</li>
        <li>What accommodation services will be provided?</li>
        <li>How to ensure that all event material will be accessible?</li>
        <li>How to invite attendees?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Second you will get ready to run your event. We recommend:</p>

        <li>If necessary, conducting a dry run</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Third, you will run your event. Please ensure:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To test the equipment and set up interpreters before the start of the event</li>
        <li>To set the tone of the event by reading out the recommended attendee etiquette</li>
        <li>To stop, acknowledge and rectify accessibility mishaps on the fly</li>
        <li>To close the event by informing attendees on how to contact you and give feedback</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Finally, after the event, you will want to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Send recap content like notes and recordings to attendees</li>
        <li>Respond to post-event questions</li>
        <li>Collect feedback from participants to improve</li>

      <h5 id="one-session-in-french-one-session-in-english-best-choice-for-accessibility" tabindex="-1">One session in French one session in English (best choice for accessibility)</h5>
      <p>When possible schedule two separate sessions, one in French and one in English. This is especially good for mandatory and statutory training.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Why?</strong> This simplifies the use of interpretation and captioning services. It also avoids excluding unilingual participants. Keep in mind that some people cannot use captions, for example, screen reader users</li>
      </ul>
      <h5 id="bilingual-best-choice-for-official-languages-requirement" tabindex="-1">Bilingual (best choice for official languages requirement)</h5>
      <p>Bilingual events are an option, especially for conferences and all-staff / weekly events.</p>
      <p>When organizing a bilingual event, you will want to ensure:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All materials related to the event, such as: invitations, agendas, handouts, minutes, PowerPoints, etc., are available in both English and French and are of the same quality</li>
        <li>Simultaneous translation <ul>
            <li>Ideally, there should be three audio channels: English, French and multilingual</li>
            <li>The presenter and the interpreter must use the same audio channel for the same language. When the presenter changes language, the interpreter comes onto the line and translates the speech until the presenter switches again</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Captioning service for both languages</li>
        <li>Plan ahead for language switching during the event, try to switch languages between sections instead of within the same slide to make it easier to follow <ul>
            <li>As of publication, MS Teams does not do automatic language detection</li>
            <li>Give a forewarning when switching to a different language, announce the change and pause for 5 to 10 seconds to allow participants time to change the language of captions</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Have a language keeper in charge of keeping a balance between French and English. This person should make sure that both official languages are used fairly and evenly during the event</li>
        <li>Greet all participants in both French and English</li>
        <li>Remind participants that they are free to use the official language of their choice</li>
        <li>Summarize each participant’s remarks in the other language</li>

      <h4 id="decide-which-virtual-platform-to-host-your-event" tabindex="-1">Decide which virtual platform to host your event</h4>
      <p>Please choose a platform whose user interface that conforms to level AA of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG 2.1 standard</a>. Additionally, we recommend reaching out to users with disabilities to test the usability of your platform and the way you’ve implemented your event. Refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/remote-meetings/#selection">Selecting an accessible remote meeting platform from the Accessibility of Remote Meetings W3C Group Note</a> for detailed guidance.</p>
      <h4 id="assign-roles-and-responsibilities-to-your-event-staff" tabindex="-1">Assign roles and responsibilities to your event staff</h4>
      <p>Smaller events may have some staff with multiple roles. Bigger events will present more challenges and will necessitate a greater distribution of tasks. Keep in mind that third parties, like audio-visual production companies, can be used to handle some of these tasks.</p>
      <p>In general, we usually see the following roles, this guidance is not prescriptive:</p>
      <h5 id="host-leader-of-the-event" tabindex="-1">Host / Leader of the event</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Introduce speakers</li>
        <li>Announce the attendee etiquette</li>
        <li>Guide the event and set the tone</li>
        <li>Ask questions to the presenters on behalf of the audience</li>
        <li>Closes the event and shares the contact for after the event</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> It is recommended to have one host / leader of the event as attendees feel more comfortable hearing a familiar voice.</p>
      <h5 id="moderators" tabindex="-1">Moderator(s)</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Monitor and answer participants through the chat or Q&amp;A area</li>
        <li>Post pertinent links in the chat for the attendees</li>
        <li>Ban disruptive persons from the event</li>

        <li>Verbally answer questions from the audience</li>
      </ul>
      <h5 id="administrator-support" tabindex="-1">Administrator / Support</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Point of contact for all attendees and service providers in case they run into issues (such as technical difficulties, access problems, or general questions about the event)</li>
        <li>Schedules the event and ensures that the event settings are right</li>
      </ul>
      <h5 id="notetaker" tabindex="-1">Notetaker</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Document key points, discussions, and action items of the event</li>
        <li>May be optional if there is automatic transcription and the transcription is corrected and edited after the event</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The distribution of notes after the event is important, especially for attendees who have difficulties listening and writing at the same time.</p>
      <h4 id="book-accommodation-services-once-the-date-is-confirmed" tabindex="-1">Book accommodation services once the date is confirmed</h4>
      <p>Accommodations may be necessary to fulfill the obligations outlines in the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32634">Directive on the Duty to Accommodate</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Please provide the presentation material (such as PowerPoint, Word, email, pre-recorded videos) to service providers in advance. Due to high demand, we suggest submitting your requests at least 4 weeks before the event.</p>
      <h5 id="sign-language-interpretation-services-asl-lsq" tabindex="-1">Sign language interpretation services (ASL, LSQ)</h5>
      <p>People who are deaf, hard of hearing, or sign language-fluent may struggle with written captions as it's their second language. Sign language interpretation also enhances the experience by conveying intonation, emotion, and meaningful audio information.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To book sign language interpretation for GC conferences and events, please visit: <a href="https://gcintranet.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/bt-tb/interpretation/signe-sign-eng.html">Sign language interpretation services<span class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt mrgn-lft-sm mrgn-rght-sm" aria-hidden="true"></span><span class="wb-inv"> Internal link</span></a></li>
      </ul>
      <h5 id="communication-access-realtime-translation-cart" tabindex="-1">Communication Access Realtime Translation (<abbr>CART</abbr>)</h5>
      <p>Captions enables people who are deaf, have a hearing loss and people who have cognitive disabilities like auditory processing difficulties, and even people for who French and English might not be their first language, to be able to fully participate in live events.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To book CART services, please visit: <a href="https://www.chs.ca/service/cart-communication-access-realtime-translation">CART – Communication Access Realtime Translation</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Some virtual events platforms offer automated live captions, like <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-live-captions-in-a-teams-meeting-4be2d304-f675-4b57-8347-cbd000a21260">Microsoft Teams Live Captions</a>. Unfortunately, these technologies often make errors which disadvantages users who rely on captions. Automated captions should be used as a last resort only or for events of lower importance. Use Communication Access Realtime Translation (<abbr>CART</abbr>) instead.</p>
      <h5 id="simultaneous-translation-interpretation-services" tabindex="-1">Simultaneous translation interpretation services</h5>
      <p>Bilingual events can be a barrier for unilingual individuals with disabilities. To ensure full accessibility, simultaneous voiced translations are necessary. Translated captions or on-screen content alone cannot be accessed by non-visual users. As a result, they must wait for language switches without any stimuli and rely solely on summaries of the talking points in their language.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To book simultaneous translation for GC conferences and events please visit: <ul>

          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This requires a virtual platform that offers multiple voice channels, one for each language. When the presenter is no longer speaking the voice channel’s language, the interpreter assigned to the voice channel must speak the translation.</p>
      <h4 id="ensure-all-event-materials-are-accessible-such-as-email-powerpoints-word" tabindex="-1">Ensure all event materials are accessible (such as email, PowerPoints, Word…)</h4>
      <p>All content distributed must be accessible and in both official languages. When possible, favour more accessible formats like HTML, Word, PowerPoint, ePub over less accessible formats like PDF.</p>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> Always review the presenters’ material even when the presenter is external as you will be accountable for the accessibility of the content.</p>
      <h5 id="training" tabindex="-1">Training</h5>
      <p>Consider taking some training about accessibility. When content is made by people who have built their accessibility knowledge and they apply it from the beginning, it saves a lot of time and money by reducing the need for remediation and avoids potential complaints.</p>
      <p>Please refer to the <a href="https://a11y.canada.ca/en/">Digital Accessibility Toolkit</a> to access more in-dept information through our guides. Additionally, we recommend watching the recorded <a href="https://www.csps-efpc.gc.ca/video/making-documents-accessible-eng.aspx">CSPS workshop called “Making Documents Accessible (INC1-V46)”</a>.</p>

      <p>Terms like “Zoombombing”, “T-BOMB”, etc. have become popular terms to describe intrusion by strangers on the internet into virtual events. Usually, intruders try to disrupt the event by sharing their camera, making noise in their mic or using the “Share Screen” feature.</p>
      <p>Here are a few tips to risk manage these attacks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure moderators know how to ban attendees</li>
        <li>If the event is public, where anyone has the right to join, ensuring that attendees mics stay muted, the cameras stay off and that they cannot share screen unless given permission will protect the event from unwanted distractions</li>
        <li>Enabling the lobby can help the screening of joining participants</li>
        <li>Some virtual platforms allow you to lock the event, such that no new participants can enter. This can be useful once confirmed that everyone that should be there, is there <ul>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> This can be problematic if someone loses connection as they cannot re-enter the event until unlocked</li>
