        <dd>
          <p>Intellectual disability is characterized by significant limitations both in intellectual functioning (reasoning, learning, problem solving) and in adaptive behavior, which covers a range of everyday social and practical skills.</p>
          <p>According to the American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, an individual has intellectual disability if they meet three criteria:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Their IQ is below 70 to 75</li>
            <li>There are significant limitations in two or more adaptive areas (skills that are needed to live, work, and play in the community, such as communication or selfcare)</li>
            <li>The condition manifests itself before the age of 18</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>Characteristics:</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>People with an intellectual disability may:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sit up, crawl, or walk later than other children</li>
            <li>Learn to talk later or have trouble understanding and speaking</li>
            <li>Find it hard to remember things</li>
            <li>Have trouble understanding social rules and cues</li>

        <dt>Definition:</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Dyslexia is a learning disability that impairs a person’s ability to read. The disability could be the result of a congenital difference, an injury, delayed development, a neurological or physical disability. Professionals identify and diagnose specific reading disabilities, such as Dyslexia in children and teenagers. Often the diagnosis of a learning disability will include components of a reading impairment.</p>
          <p>People with adult-onset dyslexia typically develop after a brain injury or in the context of dementia. Recent research has shown a number of genes that may predispose a person to developing dyslexia. Dyslexia can be inherited in some families.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Characteristics:</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Although the disorder differs from person to person, reading disabilities may include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>An inability to perceive text or to process the meaning of words, phrases and ideas</li>
            <li>Read at lower levels than expected despite having normal intelligence</li>
            <li>Difficulty with phonological processing (the manipulation of sounds), spelling, and / or rapid visual-verbal responding</li>

        <dd>Math and computational disabilities impact a person’s ability to learn and communicate math. Dyscalculia involves an inability to understand arithmetic and how to calculate. This disability can be complicated by dysgraphia, which can include an inability to draw or copy figures and graphs, and by anxiety. Dyscalculia may be congenital or result from an injury, disease, or aging.</dd>
        <dt>Characteristics:</dt>

            <li>Grasping the meaning of quantities or concepts like biggest vs smallest</li>
            <li>Word problems that require math skills</li>
            <li>Understanding that the numeral 4 is the same as the word four, and that these both mean four items</li>
            <li>Basic math concepts, such as addition, subtraction, multiplying, and dividing</li>
            <li>Remembering math facts, such as multiplication tables</li>

          <p>According to the World Health Organization: Autism spectrum disorders (<abbr>ASD</abbr>) refers to a range of conditions marked by some degree of impairment in social behaviour, communication and language, and a narrow range of interests and activities that are both unique to the individual and carried out repetitively.</p>
          <p>ASD begins in childhood and tends to continue into adolescence and adulthood. People with ASD often have co-occurring conditions, such as epilepsy, depression, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (<abbr>ADHD</abbr>). The level of intellectual functioning in individuals with ASDs is extremely variable, extending from profound impairment to superior levels.</p>
